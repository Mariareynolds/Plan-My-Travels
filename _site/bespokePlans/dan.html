    <h2> DAY 1 ITINERARY </h2>
  <p> Sydney</p>
  <p> Beach Day and Coastal Walk </p>
  <p> Bondi to Coogee coastal walk 1.5hours 
If you’re not pushed for time I’d recommend stopping at a few different beaches and make a day of it. My personal favourite stops are Gordons Bay and Tamara. You’ll also want to do the Bondi Icebergs (sea pools) as it’s a bit of a tourist spot. Bondi and Coogee are the largest of the beaches and you will find restaurants for breakfast or lunch at either end. Coogee Bay beach Hotel has a great atmosphere for afternoon drinks.
You will find a cafe at Tamara that does Milkshakes and light lunches or smoothies and fish and chips from the beach hut at Bronte.

Coogee Pavilion is a good spot for a night out if you’re looking for a dance floor! </p>

  <h2> DAY 2 ITINERARY </h2>
<p> Sydney</p>
<p> Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge Climb </p>
<p> Sydney Opera House tour.
Tickets can be bought for $42. The tour is roughly an hour long and will teach you about the architecture of the building and some of the iconic performances that have taken place there. If this isn’t your thing you can still take a walk along the Quay and take pictures of this hotspot as well as the Harbour Bridge. https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/visit-us/tours-and-experiences/english-tour.html

Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb.
It’s a little pricey but if It’s been on your bucket list and you only plan on being here once then I’d say it’s worth it. I did the twilight tour which I recommend.  It takes around 3.5 hours. The starting price for this climb is $270 however it can get a bit more expensive depending on the time of day you decide to book and also weekends vs weekdays. https://www.bridgeclimb.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8W8l5UAoqmUZY3ZaPAPbZiM1AQxcf7o2gCFQ0eKAI6ufGUjP93x1d4aAkzcEALw_wcB

Lunch/dinner at the Opera house. Considering the location the Opera bar is really well priced. Great cocktails and a beautiful backdrop.  https://www.operabar.com.au/menu-eat </p>

  <h2> DAY 3 ITINERARY </h2>
<p> Sydney</p>
<p> Spit to Manly Coastal Walk </p>
<p> Spit to Manly Coastal walk.
The walk takes between 2.5-3hours and the terrain is overall pretty flat with a hand full of small inclines. You can take either the 178 or 180 bus from Wynyard station (check this using google maps before you leave as alternate bus routes may be available depending on the time of day) to Spit West Reserve I.e the start of the Spit bridge. The coastal walk starts on the seaboard side of the bridge.(walk across the bridge and the path is on the left hand side. It’s a fairly easy walk but wear walking shoes as it’s 10km. Also make sure you take plenty of water as there is only 1 cafe along the path, around 30-45mins from the start. The walk has lots of beautiful beaches and view points across the harbour.
At the end of the walk you will arrive at Manly Wharf. I recommend either the Manly Hotel or the Manly Skiff for lunch. Both are on the waterfront and have good food/cocktails. If you’re looking for something cheaper try Betty’s Burgers at the Ferry terminal. Spend the afternoon at the Manly Main beach (This is not the beach you see when you first arrive, it’s a few minutes walk) or shop along the highstreet. There are loads of great bikini stores here.
Take the Ferry from Manly wharf back to Circular Quay. If you go on a Sunday travel is capped at $2.80. Ferry takes around 30minutes.

  <h2> DAY 5 ITINERARY </h2>
<p> Sydney </p>
<p> Taronga Zoo Day Trip </p>
<p> Taronga Zoo You can make your way to Taronga Zoo either by Bus or Ferry depending on where you are in the City. I recommend taking the Ferry from Circular Quay directly to Taronga Zoo, you can only do this if you have also purchased a ticket that allows you access to the Skycar  as the Skycar will pick you up from the Ferry terminal and take you over the top of the Zoo enclosures to the entrance of the Zoo. It’s a great way to start you Zoo experience as you can see lots of the animals roaming their enclosures. If you have not rebooked tickets or got access to the Skycar then you can catch a bus from Wynyard station that will take you over the Harbour Bridge and drop you at the entrance. Taronga Zoo has a cafe and also a large restaurant that serves hot food such as burgers and chips or fish and chips, as well as ice cream and light snacks.  ickets are normally around XXX and can be purchased online at …. You can also purchase experiences such as behind the scenes tours with Australian  animals or even an overnight stay in the animal kingdom. </p>

Take the tram to St Kilda to visit Melbourne’s closest beach (Very different to the beaches on the East Coast). Whilst your here check out Luna Park!
In the evening head to Curtin House Rooftop Bar to experience Melbourne nightlife. Melbourne is known for its cool bars and coffee shops. As it’s your first day in Aus take it easy but keep busy so you can stay up until a reasonable hour which will help you adjust to the jet lag.  Check out the City from above at the Eureka skydeck. </p>
