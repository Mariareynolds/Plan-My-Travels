    <p>  Bondi to Coogee coastal walk 1.5hours
If you’re not pushed for time I’d recommend stopping at a few different beaches and make a day of it. Some underrated favourites are Gordons Bay and Tamara. You’ll also want to do the Bondi Icebergs (sea pools) as it’s a bit of a tourist spot. Bondi and Coogee are the largest of the beaches and you will find restaurants for breakfast or lunch at either end. Coogee Bay beach Hotel has a great atmosphere for afternoon drinks.
You will find a cafe at Tamara that does Milkshakes and light lunches or smoothies and fish and chips from the beach hut at Bronte.

Coogee Pavilion is a good spot for a night out if you’re looking for a dance floor!

    <h2> DAY 2  </h2>
    
    <p> <span> Location: </span>Sydney </p>
    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Spit to Manly Coastal Walk </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  The walk takes between 2.5-3hours and the terrain is overall pretty flat with a hand full of small inclines. You can take either the 178 or 180 bus from Wynyard station (check this using google maps before you leave as alternate bus routes may be available depending on the time of day) to Spit West Reserve I.e the start of the Spit bridge. The coastal walk starts on the seaboard side of the bridge.(walk across the bridge and the path is on the left hand side. It’s a fairly easy walk but wear walking shoes as it’s 10km. Also make sure you take plenty of water as there is only 1 cafe along the path, around 30-45mins from the start. The walk has lots of beautiful beaches and view points across the harbour.
At the end of the walk you will arrive at Manly Wharf. I recommend either the Manly Hotel or the Manly Skiff for lunch. Both are on the waterfront and have good food/cocktails. If you’re looking for something cheaper try Betty’s Burgers at the Ferry terminal. Spend the afternoon at the Manly Main beach (This is not the beach you see when you first arrive, it’s a few minutes walk) or shop along the highstreet. There are loads of great bikini stores here.
Take the Ferry from Manly wharf back to Circular Quay. If you go on a Sunday travel is capped at $2.80. Ferry takes around 30minutes.

    <p>  Get settled in to life in Byron Bay by getting to know the area. Spend the morning browsing the boutique shops filled with a mixture of vintage and surfing styles. The one of a kind shops here will make you want to spend spend spend!

Kayak with Dolphins with the team at Cape Byron Kayaks, who are located a short walk to the right of Main Beach. The team are fantastic and will do their absolute best to find some marine life but you have to remember the time of year you go can affect what you will be able to see. I kayaked with them and managed to see a pod of Dolphins and some Turtles but best of all we had a mumma Whale and her baby wave a fin hello before ducking under our kayaks and swimming straight past us. Honestly a travel highlight! <a target="_blank" href="https://www.capebyronkayaks.com/"> Cape Byron Kayaks </a>

Head back into town for a lunch stop at Miss Margarita's a highly popular Mexican restaurant which, as you can probably guess, does great margarita's! There can be a waiting time of up to an hour and they don't take reservations so I'd recommend a late lunch/ early dinner around 4-5pm in order to secure a table. Or you could even just head there for happy hour which is between 4pm-6pm and sip all the cocktails before dinner that evening.


Accommodation Tip: The Bayhaven Lodge has adorable rooms, some of which have access to the garden. My room was spotless and decorated beautifully in a Byron style, the Bayhaven Lodge is around a 5 minute walk to the main road of shops and restaurants in Byron Bay and it's in an ideal location for anyone travelling with a car or van as there is free on street parking just 100metres away. Alternatively if your looking at hostels Nomads has really spacious rooms with ensuite bathrooms.

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Start with a breakfast yoghurt and smoothie at Sweet Byron on the corner of Jonsons and Lawsons street. Little tip if you can guess the weight of your frozen yogurt it will be free! Then make your way to Wategos Beach via Lighthouse Road. The walk to Wategos Beach is around 3km and will take roughly 45 minutes or just 7 minutes to drive from Main Beach. There is limited free parking so I recommend getting here before 10am or alternatively head just up the hill from the beach where you will find on street free parking. If you are looking to park just off of the beach you should again arrive early and be prepared to pay for parking that will be limited to a maximum of 4hours.

Wategos Beach sits just under the Lighthouse surrounded by some of Byrons most prestigious properties. You'll find some serious #HouseGoals here and will probably start planning your retirement. You can make use of the public BBQ and picnic benches on the grass to the left hand side of the beach or maybe grab a coffee and from Soul Kitchen cafe. The beach is just perfect, the sand is pristine and the waters are warm and shallow meaning you can wade out and play with a ball or frisbee before the bank drops off.

Finish off the day with sunset at The Wreck, located just off of the Main Beach in Byron, whilst listening to the performers in Apex Park, you'll find lots of street performers in Byron and this is a great spot to sit and relax amongst them.
Once the sun has set head to The Balcony for cocktails and dinner.
Tip: The Balcony has different offers each night of the week so do a little research and you may find some great deals.

    <h2> DAY 9  </h2>
    
    <p> <span> Location: </span>Byron Bay </p>
    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Sunrise at the Lighthouse and Surf lesson </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Let your alarm clock for EARLY! (Google sunrise, roughly 5:30am). Head up to the Lighthouse for sunrise, it's so worth the morning hike for a chance to see this view. Byron Bay Lighthouse is located at Cape Byron, the most Easterly point of Australia. From the top you are likely to see all kinds of sea life. I've spotted Turtles, Dolphins and even Whales passing by from up here.

Afternoon surf lesson at Lennox head with Mojo Surf. If you head to Mojo Surf on Fletcher street they can book you in for a morning or afternoon session running at either 8:30am or 12:30pm. I would recommend a morning session as we found the waves to be very choppy in the afternoon and we were running out of time to find a good spot to surf. Lennox head has a huge stretch of beach and  perfect conditions for learning to surf. The lessons are around 3-4 hours so you'll be finishing around lunch time but before heading back to Byron you need to check out Lake Ainsworth just off of the beach. <a target="_blank" href=https://mojosurf.com/products/2-5-day-surf-stay-byron-bay/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8XIzMtDgU1-kr2YyPu42OmSdpa1oPxh9UQdLtzNGvj4amtptu2nP8saAgn-EALw_wcB"> Mojo Surf </a>
Lake Ainsworth is a tea tree lake which essentially means the oils from the surrounding tea trees seep in to the lake turning the water so dark it's almost impossible to clearly see your own hands under the water. The effects of this however means your hair and skin feel  smooth and silky even after stepping out of the salty sea. The water is so warm it's almost like bath water. It's a beautiful place to relax until sunset with some lilo's and a few drinks before heading off to the next spot on your east coast adventure.


Round off the day at main beach before heading to Cheeky Monkeys for a night of  super cheap happy hour drinks and dancing on tables!

Tip: Check their websites as they often have theme nights or quiz nights. We managed to win the quiz  and got some free surfing lessons which was a perfect plan for the rest of our stay.

    <h2> DAY 10  </h2>
    
    <p> <span> Location: </span>Byron Bay </p>
    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Waterfalls </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Head out to Killen Falls, it's around a half an hour drive and then just a 10 minute walk to the waterfall. Make sure you are in comfortable shoes as it can be a little slippery. The waterfall sits over a cave meaning you can walk behind it or set up in the shade whilst you're swimming beneath the waterfall.

The final stop is Minyon Falls. Minyon falls is a 45 minute drive North of Killen falls in Nightcap National Park. The waterfall itself is 100m and you can take an 8km circuit to see the top and bottom of the waterfall. However one thing to take in to consideration is the weather, I took the 40 minute drive on a nice hot day and found one very dried out waterfall. So at 8:00am It was a little frustrating, however I thought I'd do a little exploring. At the top of the waterfall there were a few pockets of water that are deep enough to use as plunge pools overlooking the national park.

    <h2> DAY 11  </h2>
    
    <p> <span> Location: </span>Gold Coast </p>
    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Theme Parks </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  THEME PARKS! Byron is around an hour from the Gold Coast theme parks so why would you not take at least one day to check out these parks. I'm not a huge theme park fan but Movie World was pretty cool plus there are loads of other parks to choose from depending on what you enjoy. The parks open at 9:30am however the rides don't start until 10am so it's handy to get there early and get in line for the first ride of the day to make sure you can do as much as possible. The best part is as the time zone is an hour behind you actually gain an hour when crossing the border meaning if you leave Byron at 9am you'll get to movie world at 9am, it's like magic!

If you are looking to get to Byron or the Gold Coast from the Airport the Skybus operates every 2 hours with a one way trip at just $28 for the 55minute journey which is much cheaper than any of the taxi's available. It's worth checking the timetable in advance as you may find yourself just missing a shuttle and having to wait 2 hours.

    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Burleigh Heads is the trendiest spot on the Gold Coast. Beautiful yet quiet beaches and a great atmosphere. Burleigh is a great spot to spend a night and relax mid way through your trip. You can visit Currumbin wildlife centre to cuddle a koala and feed the karangaroo’s for a really reasonable price. Or if you just want to explore you you can visit Currumbin which is a small surf town, again with pretty beaches and coffee shops. In the evening head to Burleigh pavilion for some nightlife. It has a great sunset spot on the water so soak up all the beach vibes. < a target="_blank" href="https://www.skybus.com.au/byron-bay-express/timetable/"> Sky bus </a>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  You can get to Brisbane by public transport anywhere along the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast. If you've spent most of your trip exploring beaches and the great outdoors you could spend the day in the City. Head to Queens Street Mall for some shopping and maybe get some lunch at Jimmy's on the Mall. Jimmy's is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and offers live music and a great cocktail menu.
Then maybe take a river cruise to check out the city from the water. Sightseeing River Cruises start from just $30.
If you're looking for nightlife head to Fortitude Valley for bars and nightclubs.

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Take a walk along Victoria Bridge towards South Bank where you'll find the Brisbane Wheel. The wheel is 200ft high, giving you a great view over Brisbane River. The tickets are $22 each for 4 loops.
Continue along South Bank to find the markets. The markets have a variety of clothes, artwork, jewellery and food stools and they are open Friday to Sunday. Once you've finished browsing you can get food and cocktails at South Bank Social, overlooking the  man-made beach. Brisbane has some good nightlife, fortitude valley is often recommended.

Get to Brisbane from either the Gold Coast or the Sunshine Coast via easy to navigate trains and buses. THis section of the East Coast is probably the easiest to get around using public transport and all within a few hours.
