    <p>  Bondi to Coogee coastal walk 1.5hours
If you’re not pushed for time I’d recommend stopping at a few different beaches and make a day of it. Some underrated favourites are Gordons Bay and Tamara. You’ll also want to do the Bondi Icebergs (sea pools) as it’s a bit of a tourist spot. Bondi and Coogee are the largest of the beaches and you will find restaurants for breakfast or lunch at either end. Coogee Bay beach Hotel has a great atmosphere for afternoon drinks.
You will find a cafe at Tamara that does Milkshakes and light lunches or smoothies and fish and chips from the beach hut at Bronte.

Coogee Pavilion is a good spot for a night out if you’re looking for a dance floor!

    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Spit to Manly Coastal Walk </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  The walk takes between 2.5-3hours and the terrain is overall pretty flat with a hand full of small inclines. You can take either the 178 or 180 bus from Wynyard station (check this using google maps before you leave as alternate bus routes may be available depending on the time of day) to Spit West Reserve I.e the start of the Spit bridge. The coastal walk starts on the seaboard side of the bridge.(walk across the bridge and the path is on the left hand side. It’s a fairly easy walk but wear walking shoes as it’s 10km. Also make sure you take plenty of water as there is only 1 cafe along the path, around 30-45mins from the start. The walk has lots of beautiful beaches and view points across the harbour.
At the end of the walk you will arrive at Manly Wharf. I recommend either the Manly Hotel or the Manly Skiff for lunch. Both are on the waterfront and have good food/cocktails. If you’re looking for something cheaper try Betty’s Burgers at the Ferry terminal. Spend the afternoon at the Manly Main beach (This is not the beach you see when you first arrive, it’s a few minutes walk) or shop along the highstreet. There are loads of great bikini stores here.
Take the Ferry from Manly wharf back to Circular Quay. If you go on a Sunday travel is capped at $2.80. Ferry takes around 30minutes.

    <p>  Get settled in to life in Byron Bay by getting to know the area. Spend the morning browsing the boutique shops filled with a mixture of vintage and surfing styles. The one of a kind shops here will make you want to spend spend spend!

Kayak with Dolphins with the team at Cape Byron Kayaks, who are located a short walk to the right of Main Beach. The team are fantastic and will do their absolute best to find some marine life but you have to remember the time of year you go can affect what you will be able to see. I kayaked with them and managed to see a pod of Dolphins and some Turtles but best of all we had a mumma Whale and her baby wave a fin hello before ducking under our kayaks and swimming straight past us. Honestly a travel highlight! <a target="_blank" href="https://www.capebyronkayaks.com/"> Cape Byron Kayaks </a>

Head back into town for a lunch stop at Miss Margarita's a highly popular Mexican restaurant which, as you can probably guess, does great margarita's! There can be a waiting time of up to an hour and they don't take reservations so I'd recommend a late lunch/ early dinner around 4-5pm in order to secure a table. Or you could even just head there for happy hour which is between 4pm-6pm and sip all the cocktails before dinner that evening.


Accommodation Tip: The Bayhaven Lodge has adorable rooms, some of which have access to the garden. My room was spotless and decorated beautifully in a Byron style, the Bayhaven Lodge is around a 5 minute walk to the main road of shops and restaurants in Byron Bay and it's in an ideal location for anyone travelling with a car or van as there is free on street parking just 100metres away. Alternatively if your looking at hostels Nomads has really spacious rooms with ensuite bathrooms.

There is limited free parking so I recommend getting here before 10am or alternatively head just up the hill from the beach where you will find on street free parking. If you are looking to park just off of the beach you should again arrive early and be prepared to pay for parking that will be limited to a maximum of 4hours.

Wategos Beach sits just under the Lighthouse surrounded by some of Byrons most prestigious properties. You'll find some serious #HouseGoals here and will probably start planning your retirement. You can make use of the public BBQ and picnic benches on the grass to the left hand side of the beach or maybe grab a coffee and from Soul Kitchen cafe. The beach is just perfect, the sand is pristine and the waters are warm and shallow meaning you can wade out and play with a ball or frisbee before the bank drops off.

Finish off the day with sunset at The Wreck, located just off of the Main Beach in Byron, whilst listening to the performers in Apex Park, you'll find lots of street performers in Byron and this is a great spot to sit and relax amongst them.
Once the sun has set head to The Balcony for cocktails and dinner.
Tip: The Balcony has different offers each night of the week so do a little research and you may find some great deals.

    <h2> DAY 9  </h2>
    
    <p> <span> Location: </span>Byron Bay </p>
    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Sunrise at the Lighthouse and Surf lesson </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Let your alarm clock for EARLY! (Google sunrise, roughly 5:30am). Head up to the Lighthouse for sunrise, it's so worth the morning hike for a chance to see this view. Byron Bay Lighthouse is located at Cape Byron, the most Easterly point of Australia. From the top you are likely to see all kinds of sea life. I've spotted Turtles, Dolphins and even Whales passing by from up here.

Afternoon surf lesson at Lennox head with Mojo Surf. If you head to Mojo Surf on Fletcher street they can book you in for a morning or afternoon session running at either 8:30am or 12:30pm. I would recommend a morning session as we found the waves to be very choppy in the afternoon and we were running out of time to find a good spot to surf. Lennox head has a huge stretch of beach and  perfect conditions for learning to surf. The lessons are around 3-4 hours so you'll be finishing around lunch time but before heading back to Byron you need to check out Lake Ainsworth just off of the beach. <a target="_blank" href=https://mojosurf.com/products/2-5-day-surf-stay-byron-bay/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8XIzMtDgU1-kr2YyPu42OmSdpa1oPxh9UQdLtzNGvj4amtptu2nP8saAgn-EALw_wcB"> Mojo Surf </a>
Lake Ainsworth is a tea tree lake which essentially means the oils from the surrounding tea trees seep in to the lake turning the water so dark it's almost impossible to clearly see your own hands under the water. The effects of this however means your hair and skin feel  smooth and silky even after stepping out of the salty sea. The water is so warm it's almost like bath water. It's a beautiful place to relax until sunset with some lilo's and a few drinks before heading off to the next spot on your east coast adventure.


Round off the day at main beach before heading to Cheeky Monkeys for a night of  super cheap happy hour drinks and dancing on tables!

Tip: Check their websites as they often have theme nights or quiz nights. We managed to win the quiz  and got some free surfing lessons which was a perfect plan for the rest of our stay.

    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Waterfalls </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Head out to Killen Falls, it's around a half an hour drive and then just a 10 minute walk to the waterfall. Make sure you are in comfortable shoes as it can be a little slippery. The waterfall sits over a cave meaning you can walk behind it or set up in the shade whilst you're swimming beneath the waterfall.

The final stop is Minyon Falls. Minyon falls is a 45 minute drive North of Killen falls in Nightcap National Park. The waterfall itself is 100m and you can take an 8km circuit to see the top and bottom of the waterfall. However one thing to take in to consideration is the weather, I took the 40 minute drive on a nice hot day and found one very dried out waterfall. So at 8:00am It was a little frustrating, however I thought I'd do a little exploring. At the top of the waterfall there were a few pockets of water that are deep enough to use as plunge pools overlooking the national park.

    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Theme Parks </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  THEME PARKS! Byron is around an hour from the Gold Coast theme parks so why would you not take at least one day to check out these parks. I'm not a huge theme park fan but Movie World was pretty cool plus there are loads of other parks to choose from depending on what you enjoy. The parks open at 9:30am however the rides don't start until 10am so it's handy to get there early and get in line for the first ride of the day to make sure you can do as much as possible. The best part is as the time zone is an hour behind you actually gain an hour when crossing the border meaning if you leave Byron at 9am you'll get to movie world at 9am, it's like magic!

If you are looking to get to Byron or the Gold Coast from the Airport the Skybus operates every 2 hours with a one way trip at just $28 for the 55minute journey which is much cheaper than any of the taxi's available. It's worth checking the timetable in advance as you may find yourself just missing a shuttle and having to wait 2 hours.

    <p>  Burleigh Heads is the trendiest spot on the Gold Coast. Beautiful yet quiet beaches and a great atmosphere. Burleigh is a great spot to spend a night and relax mid way through your trip. You can visit Currumbin wildlife centre to cuddle a koala and feed the karangaroo’s for a really reasonable price. Or if you just want to explore you you can visit Currumbin which is a small surf town, again with pretty beaches and coffee shops. In the evening head to Burleigh pavilion for some nightlife. It has a great sunset spot on the water so soak up all the beach vibes. < a target="_blank" href="https://www.skybus.com.au/byron-bay-express/timetable/"> Sky bus </a>

    <p>  You can get to Brisbane by public transport anywhere along the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast. If you've spent most of your trip exploring beaches and the great outdoors you could spend the day in the City. Head to Queens Street Mall for some shopping and maybe get some lunch at Jimmy's on the Mall. Jimmy's is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and offers live music and a great cocktail menu.
Then maybe take a river cruise to check out the city from the water. Sightseeing River Cruises start from just $30.
If you're looking for nightlife head to Fortitude Valley for bars and nightclubs.

    <p>  Take a walk along Victoria Bridge towards South Bank where you'll find the Brisbane Wheel. The wheel is 200ft high, giving you a great view over Brisbane River. The tickets are $22 each for 4 loops.
Continue along South Bank to find the markets. The markets have a variety of clothes, artwork, jewellery and food stools and they are open Friday to Sunday. Once you've finished browsing you can get food and cocktails at South Bank Social, overlooking the  man-made beach. Brisbane has some good nightlife, fortitude valley is often recommended.

Get to Brisbane from either the Gold Coast or the Sunshine Coast via easy to navigate trains and buses. THis section of the East Coast is probably the easiest to get around using public transport and all within a few hours.

    <p> <span> Location: </span>Glass House Mountains </p>
    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Hiking </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  There are lots of different mountains to climb here so make sure you check the difficulty of each mountain before you decide which one is best for you. Make sure you have everything you need before you set off, including water and suitable shoes. Take my advice and DO NOT do any of these in flip flops (thongs) because even one of the easiest mountains will be impossible.
The below website has some great information about the different walking tracks and the difficulty levels of each of the mountains.
<a target="_blank" href="https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/parks/glass-house-mountains/about.html#summit_routes"> Glass House Mountains </a>
One example is Mount Beerburrum which is one of the less extreme mountains to climb and I have to say it is still extremely steep however it is one of the shorter climbs. I recommend getting to the top in time for sunset as the views are incredible. If you decide to climb Mount Beerburrum then I would recommend starting the climb an hour before sunset to allow you plenty of time to get to the top.
Before you set off make sure you check mountain closures online as currently some of the mountains are closed for resurfacing.
The Glass HOuse Mountains are easily accessed on the train from Brisbane towards Noosa or vice versa. THe reason I suggested Mount Beerburrum is because you can get off the train at Beerburrum station and it's around a 10 minute walk to the bottom of the mountain. the trains come every 1-1.5hours so make sure you time the trains that you plan to catch to continue your journey as there isn't anywhere else to go around the station.  If you are travelling with suitcases I wouldn't recommend doing the hike unless you have accomodation to leave your belongings at.

    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Australia Zoo belongs to the famous Irwin family. It’s an East Coast ‘MUST DO’ so make sure it’s on your bucket list.
You can get a free shuttle from Beerwah station that takes you straight to the Zoo or take a public bus, as many routes go to the Zoo directly. The opening times are 9am-5pm daily including weekends and school holidays, however these are naturally a lot busier. One of the perks of visiting during the school holidays, the Zoo hosts lots of extra seasonal activities and you are likely to see the Irwins themselves hosting crocodile feeding shows, Tigers talks and more.

An adult admission ticket is $59 and a childs' ticket is $35, you can also purchase annual passes meaning you'll save money if you plan to visit the zoo more than once.
If you're looking to get a bit closer to the animals the Zoo offers lots of different encounters meaning you can cuddle up to Tiger cubs, lemurs or get yourself an infamous koala selfie.

    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Mooloolaba is a beautiful beach town South of the Sunshine Coast airport, Mooloolaba is likened to Noosa, however, its a little less pricey and definitely not as busy. It seems more of a local town rather than a tourist hotspot although it’s perfect for a beach day on your journey along the coast.
The coastal town has lots of restaurants and cafes as well as super affordable shops, I bought some absolute bargains here and would go back for the clothes alone!
Start the day with a coffee along the promenade and then head off to do some shopping. In the afternoon you can head to the pristine white beach that feels almost empty, it’s really quiet even during school holidays. The sea is calm and you can take a look in some rock pools to the far left hand side of the beach.
End the afternoon with dinner and cocktails either at The Beach Bar and Grill or Mooloolaba Surf club. Both offers beautiful beach views.
Mooloolaba is also a great place to base yourself if you plan to visit Australia Zoo or the Glass House Mountains as it's a short journey on a train or bus.

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Beach day and Boutique Shopping
text: Noosa is a boutique beach town, North of the Sunshine Coast Airport, that is full of coffee shops and luxury clothing stores, set amongst sprawling million dollar homes. Hastings street is the main shopping street, set metres back from the beach making it the ideal place to visit if you’re looking to treat yourself a little and relax at the beach once you’ve done so.
You can either grab a coffee on Hastings street, every coffee shop is dog friendly and you will be surrounded by pooches, or try a vegan ice-cream from Happy Pops. The peanut butter flavour is the best ice-cream I’ve ever tasted. It’s like ice-cream thats not cold? I can't explain it any better so you'll just have to try it. If you’re looking for some summer clothes have a look at Goddess clothing for some bargains.
Spend the day at the beach and relax.
Once you've finished your day at the beach you can take a walk along the everglades before dinner to catch a glimpse of your future #HouseGoals.

You can get to Noosa from either Brisbane or the Sunshine Coast airport with regular buses and trains. The public transport in the area is great, it takes roughly a 1 hour from the Sunshine Coast airport by bus and costs no more than $8-10. If, however, you’d rather a direct route you can book a shuttle with Con-X-ion for around $35.

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Visit Noosa's National Park and join one of the many walking tracks, I personally recommend the Coastal walk if you’re looking for scenic views and hidden beaches. Make sure you take some water and snacks for an afternoon at one of the beach stops.
The Noosa Fairy Pools are hidden half way along the National Park Coastal track, if you’re wearing sturdy footwear you can climb along the rocks to the Fairy Pools that are often empty. If you check the tide times and the tide is low you can head in for a swim whilst the waves crash in. Be super careful and stay away from the edges in particular on the right hand side. I saw a few people standing on top of the rocks who were knocked in when the freak waves came in which could have been very dangerous. If you plan to swim stick to the central path that takes you down to the narrowest part of the Fairy Pool as seen in the picture.

Cool dingos tours are either 2 or 3 days long. They are guided tours on a coach big enough for roughly 30 people. The accommodation is bunk style dorm rooms. Or you have the option to pay extra for a private room with a shared bathroom. I really enjoyed the 3 day tour and would recommend it however if you are really tight on time the spots that are must see’s are Lake Mackenzie, Eli Creek, Champagne pools and Maheno Shipwreck, all of which are covered in the 2 day tours with cool dingos.

All tours seem to cover the same spots however, some offer self drive 4x4’s and camping style accommodation, one that comes recommended was Pippie’s if you would prefer this.

NB: These tours can pickup from Rainbow beach which is just under 2 hours north of Noosa.
If you are short on time do a 2 day tour instead of 3. The best parts will be covered on the first 2 days.

    <h2> DAY 21  </h2>
    
    <p> <span> Location: </span>Airlie Beach </p>
    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Boathaven Beach </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Boathaven beach is one of the most recommended in Airlie as it has a stinger net all year round so you can swim with no need to worry and you also have a view of the marina as a backdrop, so if you're like me and you love to daydream about which boat will someday be yours then it's a great place to spend the afternoon. Boathaven is just a 15 minute walk from the Lagoon and just 8 minutes from the Airlie beach Hotel.

Head to lunch at the Anchor Bar and spend the afternoon at the infinity pool, sipping cocktails with a view of Hook Islands, the largest of all the Whitsundays Islands. The Anchor has a great food and drinks menu and I also recommend it for an evening spot. If you're looking for reasonably priced food then it's a really good option, I highly recommend the make your own cheesecake!

    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Airlie beach Lagoon pool is perfect to enjoy a day off of the reef. You'll find hundreds of solo travels sitting at the lagoon so if you're looking to meet people this is a great place to start. The water is warm and the lagoon has shallow areas meaning you can layout and sunbathe in the water. The lagoon has a smaller children's pool next to it so it's family friendly but you also don’t have kids splashing around in the main pool.  Some of the local restaurants such as the Treehouse and The Deck lookout across the lagoon so you can grab lunch and spend the whole day here.
In the evening head to Boaty’s with your new friends and meet some of the friendly locals. Boaty's has well priced food and often entertainment, either karaoke or a quiz night of some kind.

    <h2> DAY 23  </h2>
    
    <p> <span> Location: </span>Airlie Beach </p>
    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Whitsundays Island Tour </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  There are hundreds of day tours to Whitehaven beach, I recently did the Thundercats tour which spends 2 hours on Whitehaven and also takes you to 2 dive spots, this is an ideal tour for anyone who loves snorkelling/diving. Whitehaven is a super famous spot and it’s beautiful. I recommend a tour that spends as long as possible here to fully enjoy it. Once you’ve walked along the lookout points and walked to the beach it’ll take around 30-40minutes so head back to the beach quickly to make the most of it. <a href="https://redcatadventures.com.au/"> Thundercats 1 day Island tour </a>

You can also do a 2 day sail around the Whitsundays island. This is a very different style but will cover the same stops. You can either opt for a 1 or 2 night tour depending on the amount of time you have. This is a once in a life time opportunity and if you can handle the thought of sea sickness then I recommend it. It’s likely to be a young crowd and the tour will naturally take a slower pace between each stop as it’s a sailing boat rather than a fast boat. You can sunbathe on the deck of the boat and you’ll spend the evening sleeping there too.
PowerPlay is a company recommended by Happy Travels based in Airlie Beach <a target="_blank" href="https://sailing-whitsundays.com/whitsundays/powerplay"> Powerplay 2 day sailing trip </a>

I have done both of these options and my personal opinion is if you don’t mind being on a boat too long then I think you should do an overnight trip. It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to sail the Whitsundays.

* If you don't that either of these tours are quite for you there are hundreds of other options and I'd be more than happy to have a look at other options. *

    <h2> DAY 24  </h2>
    
    <p> <span> Location: </span>Hamilton island </p>
    <p> <span>Activity:</span> Relax at Hamilton Island Resorts </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Hamilton Island is the peak of luxury. Adult only resorts and hotel rooms with the view of the 74 Whitsundays Islands, what more could you ask for? I think Hamilton Islands is a great destination for a Honeymoon or a special occasion but at the same time it's definitely an expensive trip and if you're on a budget you're not missing too much if you chose to to stay on the main land and spend your trip doing day trips out to the Islands. Average price per night during the summer is £175-225. Booked 3 months in advance.

If you decide to stay on the mainland you can get the Ferry to Hamilton Island to explore the beauty spot but be warned it comes at a price. A return Ferry trip costs $137! It's an expensive day trip but once you arrive you can visit the resorts and of course relax on the main beach. In all honesty if you would like to visit Hamilton Island I recommend a day tour to Whitehaven beach with an additional stop at Hamilton in the afternoon.

    <div class="col-6-middle padded">


    <p>  Spend the day at the Cairns Lagoon. Much like Airlie Beach and Brisbane, Cairns has a man-made Lagoon right by the ocean where you can relax all day before heading out on one of Cairn’s famous bar crawls. Start the evening by heading to check out the Cairns night markets, they have some crazy good bargains here as well as pamper sessions and massages. After some browsing go to the Woolshed  for dinner and some table dancing before slowly making your way through all the bars in town and finishing the night at Gilligans, Cairns best Hostel for nightlife.

  <p> <span>Activity:</span> Sunrise at the Lighthouse and Surf lesson </p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="col-6-middle padded">


  <p> Set your alarm clock for EARLY! (Google sunrise, roughly 5:30am). Head up to the Lighthouse for sunrise, it's so worth the morning hike for a chance to see this view. Byron Bay Lighthouse is located at Cape Byron, the most Easterly point of Australia. From the top you are likely to see all kinds of sea life. I've spotted Turtles, Dolphins and even Whales passing by from up here.

  Afternoon surf lesson at Lennox head with Mojo Surf. If you head to Mojo Surf on Fletcher street they can book you in for a morning or afternoon session running at either 8:30am or 12:30pm. I would recommend a morning session as we found the waves to be very choppy in the afternoon and we were running out of time to find a good spot to surf. Lennox head has a huge stretch of beach and  perfect conditions for learning to surf. The lessons are around 3-4 hours so you'll be finishing around lunch time but before heading back to Byron you need to check out Lake Ainsworth just off of the beach. <a target="_blank" href=https://mojosurf.com/products/2-5-day-surf-stay-byron-bay/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8XIzMtDgU1-kr2YyPu42OmSdpa1oPxh9UQdLtzNGvj4amtptu2nP8saAgn-EALw_wcB"> Mojo Surf </a>
  Lake Ainsworth is a tea tree lake which essentially means the oils from the surrounding tea trees seep in to the lake turning the water so dark it's almost impossible to clearly see your own hands under the water. The effects of this however means your hair and skin feel  smooth and silky even after stepping out of the salty sea. The water is so warm it's almost like bath water. It's a beautiful place to relax until sunset with some lilo's and a few drinks before heading off to the next spot on your east coast adventure.
