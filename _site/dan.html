  <h2> DAY 1 ITINERARY </h2>
  <p> Sydney</p>
  <p> Beach Day and Coastal Walk </p>
  <p> Bondi to Coogee coastal walk 1.5hours .
If you’re not pushed for time I’d recommend stopping at a few different beaches and make a day of it. My personal favourite stops are Gordons Bay and Tamara. You’ll also want to do the Bondi Icebergs (sea pools) as it’s a bit of a tourist spot. Bondi and Coogee are the largest of the beaches and you will find restaurants for breakfast or lunch at either end. Coogee Bay beach Hotel has a great atmosphere for afternoon drinks.
You will find a cafe at Tamara that does Milkshakes and light lunches or smoothies and fish and chips from the beach hut at Bronte.

Coogee Pavilion is a good spot for a night out if you’re looking for a dance floor! </p>

  <h2> DAY 2 ITINERARY </h2>
<p> Sydney</p>
<p> Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge Climb </p>
<p> Sydney Opera House tour.
Tickets can be bought for $42. The tour is roughly an hour long and will teach you about the architecture of the building and some of the iconic performances that have taken place there. If this isn’t your thing you can still take a walk along the Quay and take pictures of this hotspot as well as the Harbour Bridge. https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/visit-us/tours-and-experiences/english-tour.html

Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb.
It’s a little pricey but if It’s been on your bucket list and you only plan on being here once then I’d say it’s worth it. I did the twilight tour which I recommend.  It takes around 3.5 hours. The starting price for this climb is $270 however it can get a bit more expensive depending on the time of day you decide to book and also weekends vs weekdays. https://www.bridgeclimb.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8W8l5UAoqmUZY3ZaPAPbZiM1AQxcf7o2gCFQ0eKAI6ufGUjP93x1d4aAkzcEALw_wcB

Lunch/dinner at the Opera house. Considering the location the Opera bar is really well priced. Great cocktails and a beautiful backdrop.  https://www.operabar.com.au/menu-eat </p>
