  <p> Set your alarm clock for EARLY! (Google sunrise, roughly 5:30am). Head up to the Lighthouse for sunrise, it's so worth the morning hike for a chance to see this view. Byron Bay Lighthouse is located at Cape Byron, the most Easterly point of Australia. From the top you are likely to see all kinds of sea life. I've spotted Turtles, Dolphins and even Whales passing by from up here.

  Afternoon surf lesson at Lennox head with Mojo Surf. If you head to Mojo Surf on Fletcher street they can book you in for a morning or afternoon session running at either 8:30am or 12:30pm. I would recommend a morning session as we found the waves to be very choppy in the afternoon and we were running out of time to find a good spot to surf. Lennox head has a huge stretch of beach and  perfect conditions for learning to surf. The lessons are around 3-4 hours so you'll be finishing around lunch time but before heading back to Byron you need to check out Lake Ainsworth just off of the beach. <a target="_blank" href=https://mojosurf.com/products/2-5-day-surf-stay-byron-bay/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8XIzMtDgU1-kr2YyPu42OmSdpa1oPxh9UQdLtzNGvj4amtptu2nP8saAgn-EALw_wcB"> Mojo Surf </a>
  Lake Ainsworth is a tea tree lake which essentially means the oils from the surrounding tea trees seep in to the lake turning the water so dark it's almost impossible to clearly see your own hands under the water. The effects of this however means your hair and skin feel  smooth and silky even after stepping out of the salty sea. The water is so warm it's almost like bath water. It's a beautiful place to relax until sunset with some lilo's and a few drinks before heading off to the next spot on your east coast adventure.
