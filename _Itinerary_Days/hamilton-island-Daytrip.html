  Hamilton Island is the peak of luxury. Adult only resorts and hotel rooms with the view of the 74 Whitsundays Islands, what more could you ask for? I think Hamilton Islands is a great destination for a Honeymoon or a special occasion but at the same time it's definitely an expensive trip and if you're on a budget you're not missing too much if you chose to to stay on the main land and spend your trip doing day trips out to the Islands. Average price per night during the summer is £175-225. Booked 3 months in advance.

  If you decide to stay on the mainland you can get the Ferry to Hamilton Island to explore the beauty spot but be warned it comes at a price. A return Ferry trip costs $137! It's an expensive day trip but once you arrive you can visit the resorts and of course relax on the main beach. In all honesty if you would like to visit Hamilton Island I recommend a day tour to Whitehaven beach with an additional stop at Hamilton in the afternoon.
  Additional Info: The benefits of staying on Airlie as opposed to the Islands such as Hamilton or Daydream is the cost difference. If booked in advanced you can spend a third of what you would be spending on the Islands but still stay in luxury accommodations.
