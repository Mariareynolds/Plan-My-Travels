activity: Beach Day- Worlds whitest beach
text: |
  <p>Head straight to Hyams beach for the day. This is the Guiness Book of Records whitest beach in the world!  The sand is so incredibly clean and white that it actually sqeaks as you walk across it. Hyams beach is almost 3km long so you will have lots of privacy. The waves here are pretty high and you can hear them crashing before you see the beach.</p>

  <p> Head in to Huskissons, just a 15 minute drive away to grab some lunch or dinner over looking the bay at <a href=" https://clubjervisbay.com.au/dining/">Club Jervis Bay</a> with 3 different restaurants to choose from or a few others dotted along the main street.</p>
