activity: Beach Day- Worlds whittest beach
text: |
  Head straight to Hyams beach for the day. This is the Guiness Book of Records whitest beach in the world!  The sand is so incredibly clean and white that it actually sneaks as you walk across it. Hyams beach is  X km long so you will have lots of privacy. The waves here are pretty high and you can hear them crashing before you see the beach.
