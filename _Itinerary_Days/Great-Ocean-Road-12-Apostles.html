  <p>Hire a car for 2 days to drive the Great Ocean Road. The most savy way to drive the Great ocean Road is actually a little backwards.</p>
  <p>Drive inland direct to the 12 apostles. The earlier you can get here the better because there will be lots of coach tours passing through from mid- morning onwards. Most tours only go as far as the 12 Apostles meaning the second half of the route is a lot quieter. Continue North West towards Adelaide as far as Port Fairy which is technically classed the end of the Great Ocean Road, it’s a small town with a few restaurants to stop for dinner. You can stay overnight in Warnanbool which is an area roughly 30 mins before the end of the Great Ocean Road with shops and restaurants and lots of hotels. </p>

  <p>The Great Ocean Road has lots of beauty spots along the route so here are the most recommended for this section of the Great Ocean Road. </p>

  <p>The 12 apostles-  This is the most famous stop on the Great Ocean Road, although there are technically only 8 apostles left. There will be lots of tour coaches arriving here so make sure you get here early. </p>

  <p>Gibson steps- A short walk from the 12 apostles, you can walk down to beach on the opposite side of the peninsula at the 12 apostles. The walk will take roughly 30mins each way to get down to the beach.</p>

  <p>Loch Ard Gorg.- Another nice view point just 3 minutes West of the 12 Apostles.  You can get down to the beach here too if you fancy relaxing on a sunny day. </p>

  <p>London Bridge- The next stop just beyond the 12 apostles. It’s a quick stop with lookout platforms over what has been named the London Bridge due to a large section falling down in to the sea. </p>

  <p>The Grotto- Roughly 5 minutes beyond London Bridge. The Grotto is a popular spot for taking pictures. It’s roughly a 750m walk from the car park down to the Grotto where you will be able to see through the cave and out to the Ocean. A popular instagrammable stop. </p>

  <p>(There are many other stops along this route so you may have more time to explore the rest depending on how long you stop for) </p>
