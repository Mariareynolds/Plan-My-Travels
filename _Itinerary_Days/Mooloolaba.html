  <p>Mooloolaba is a beautiful beach town South of the Sunshine Coast airport, Mooloolaba is likened to Noosa, however, its a little less pricey and definitely not as busy. It seems more of a local town rather than a tourist hotspot although it’s perfect for a beach day on your journey along the coast.</p>
  <p>The coastal town has lots of restaurants and cafes as well as super affordable shops!</p>
  <p>Start the day with a coffee along the promenade and then head off to do some shopping. In the afternoon you can head to the pristine white beach that feels almost empty, it’s really quiet even during school holidays. The sea is calm and you can take a look in some rock pools to the far left hand side of the beach.</p>
  <p>End the afternoon with dinner and cocktails either at The Beach Bar and Grill or Mooloolaba Surf club. Both offers beautiful beach views.</p>
  <p>Mooloolaba is also a great place to base yourself if you plan to visit Australia Zoo or the Glass House Mountains as it's a short journey on a train or bus.</p>

It seems more of a local town rather than a tourist hotspot although it’s perfect for a beach day on your journey along the coast.
The coastal town has lots of restaurants and cafes as well as super affordable shops, I bought some absolute bargains here and would go back for the clothes alone!
