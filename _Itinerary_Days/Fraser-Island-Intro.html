It's a camping and ecotourism destination, with beaches and swimming sites at Lake McKenzie, Lake Wabby and other freshwater pools.</p>


    <h2>Getting Around</h2>

    <p>Fraser Island doesnâ€™t have any form of transport so you can either opt for a guided tour where you can either self drive or be driven a a tour coach specifically designed for the roads on Fraser Island. The Island is completely made from sand so you need to make sure you have a suitable car if you chose to hire a car and tour the Island yourself. Many cars get stuck on the Island every year so make sure your hire car has suitable wheels or join a tour group. </p>
