    <p>The Lake Burley Griffin loop is a total of 29km and covers all three sections of the Lake. If you are looking to cover the full route you will need a full day and it can take anywhere between 6-8hours depending on your pace.  </p>
    <p>If you’re looking to do a shorter route it’s recommended to cover the centre basin (the middle section) as this covers the most landmarks along the walk and helps you find your bearings in the City. This section of the Lake is just a 5km loop and should take between 1.5-2hours. </p>

    <p>The Australian Government site provides a self guided walking tour map to help highlight the landmarks during this walk and can be downloaded here file:///Users/mariareynolds/Downloads/Lake%20Burley%20Griffin_WalkingTour_Flyer%202019_online.pdf
    </p>

    <p>End the day by heading to London Circuit, which is a great spot for pubs, bars and restaurants. </p>

    <p>Try Kokomos for a trendy vibe and lively atmosphere with a Tiki cocktail theme and street food bar, bar snacks and burgers or Sage Farm and Mint for a sophisticated sit down dinner.  King O’Malley’s is the spot for Live music and bistro food in a classic Irish pub or finally Mooseheads pub and Nightclub is a great spot to end the night as one of Canberra’s busiest night spots.  </p>
