  <p> Drive to Mornington Peninsula and spend a day at the Hot Springs and spa. You can get a day pass to enjoy the springs or if you want to treat yourself you could book a spa package. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.peninsulahotsprings.com/experiences/bathe/"> Mornington Peninsula Spa </a></p>

  <p>You can stay the night at the spa or look for alternative accommodation nearby which is likely to be a bit cheaper.
  If you are missing the East Coast beaches you can drive to Mount Martha beach which is on the Mornington Peninsula. A really private beach lined with colourful beach huts located just passed the main town of Frankston.</p>
  <p>Sorrento is another beach town worth visiting, it's right on the tip of the peninsula and has some of the best beach spots in Melbourne.</p>
