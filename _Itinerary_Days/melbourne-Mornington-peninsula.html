  If you still have access to a car you could drive to Mornington Peninsula and spend a day at the Hot Springs and spa. You can get a day pass to enjoy the springs or if you want to treat yourself you could book a spa package. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.peninsulahotsprings.com/experiences/bathe/"> Mornington Peninsula Spa </a>
  If you are missing the East Coast beaches you can drive to Mount Martha beach which is on the Mornington Peninsula. A really private beach lined with colourful beach huts located just passed the main town of Frankston.
