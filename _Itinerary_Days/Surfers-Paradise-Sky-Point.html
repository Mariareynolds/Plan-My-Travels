  <p>Head to Australia’s only beachside Observation Deck and the tallest residential building in the world. You can go up to the 77th floor and see the 360 degree view of Surfers Paradise. Tickets are $27pp for entry to the skydeck where you will get a view of the city and the beach.</p>
  <p>You can also eat at the https://www.skypoint.com.au/SkyPoint Bistro + Bar, they have an Australian menu with gluten free and vegan options as well as afternoon tea for two.</p>

  <p>If you’re a bit of an adrenaline junkie then you will want to book a climb to the summit. Australia’s highest external bridge climb stands at 270m above sea level! Tickets start at a really reasonable $77pp for a day time climb, however for $87pp you will receive a $20 food voucher the the sky point bistro so you can enjoy lunch with a view after working up an appetite.</p>

  <p>Surfers Paradise is definitely your place for night life. You’ll find lots of clubs to party all night on Orchid Avenue. You will find most of these clubs have an entry fee of $10-20 and drinks can be quite expensive but you will notice club reps outside most of these places and you’ll be able to ask around to find the best deals.</p>
