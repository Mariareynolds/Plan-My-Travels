  <p>For your second day on the island you can enjoy some of the walking trails. One of the most popular trails is the Forts walk, it’s roughly 4km and will take between 1hour and 90 minutes depending on your pace.
  The Nelly Bay to Arcadia walk is also a popular one as you get a view from the top overlooking Horseshoe Bay.</p>

  <p>If you’re feeling like more of a challenge you can do the 16km trek from Picnic Bay to West Point on the western side of the island. The landscape is very different on the western side, you’ll find mangroves and wetlands so make sure you are wearing sturdy footwear.</p>

  <p>If you prefer to explore the island by bike you can hire the from <a href="https://fnfmagneticisland.com.au/magnetic-island-bike-hire/">Magnetic Island Bike Hire</a> for $25 for 24 hours. Cycle around the Island stopping at Arthur Bay, Geoffrey Bay and Florence Bay for more beach time. </p>

  <p>Head for lunch at Le Paradis, SOS or Thai Again which are all in the area of the Ferry Port before boarding back to Townsville.</p>

<p> <span> Location: </span> Cairns </p>
<p> <span>Activity:</span> Explore the markets and Bar Crawl </p>
<p>Spend the day at the Cairns Lagoon. Much like Airlie Beach and Brisbane, Cairns has a man-made Lagoon right by the ocean where you can relax all day before heading out on one of Cairn’s famous bar crawls. Start the evening by heading to check out the Cairns night markets, they have some crazy good bargains here as well as pamper sessions and massages. After some browsing go to the Woolshed  for dinner and some table dancing before slowly making your way through all the bars in town and finishing the night at Gilligans, Cairns best Hostel for nightlife.
