  <p>Another popular day trip is out to the Yarra Valley Wineries. You could do this as a paid day trip, which we would recommend, so that you can enjoy the tastings at the wineries. Otherwise if you have your own vehicle and you are happy to be the designated driver itâ€™s just over an hour out of town. There are plenty of options. Chandon has a popular tasting menu and cheese plates.</p>
  <p>Yarra Valley Wine Tours go to different wineries, the chocolate factory and also provide lunch. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getyourguide.co.uk/melbourne-l202/yarra-valley-gourmet-tour-t28836/"> Yarra Valley Gourmet Tour</a></p>
