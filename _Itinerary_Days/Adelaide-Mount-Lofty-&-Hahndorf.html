    <p>Mount Lofty is a lookout point across the whole of Adelaide just a 25 minute drive out of the City.</p>

    <p>Mounty Lofty has 8 different walking tracks to the summit ranging from 2 to 4 hours (and back remember!) you can find out more about the walking tracks at <a href="https://www.walkingsa.org.au/news/8-ways-to-hike-up-mt-lofty/">Walking SA</a>
    Alternatively you can drive straight to the summit. There is a car park with pay and display parking and a cafe at the lookout that serves hot food and snacks for breakfast, lunch and dinner. </p>

    <p>Keep driving towards Hahndorf which is roughly 15-20 minutes away from the Mount Lofty summit. Hahndorf is a little German town hidden in the Adelaide Hills. Total journey time if driving from Adelaide is 50 minutes, via Mount Lofty or you can catch the 864F bus from Pulteney Street Adelaide (Subject to change so please use google maps) which will take roughly 1 hour. </p>

    <p>Despite being a very small town Hahndorf has plenty to do, you can visit Hahndorf Farm Barn and feed the animals, pick Strawberries at Beerenberg Family Farm, visit the German Migration Museum, play a round of mini golf or even just browse the Main Street and try out some of the ale houses. </p>

    <p>There are lots of places to eat including Udder Delights Cheese Cellar for an amazing cheese board or Haus for German dishes or pizza’s. </p>

    <p>If you don’t have a car to explore and you don’t fancy catching public transport you could opt for a day trip such as <a href=" https://sightseeingtoursaustralia.com.au/tours/1-day-adelaide-city-hahndorf-tour/">1 Day Adelaide City and Hahndorf Tour.</a> The tour is only 4 hours so you may not get a chance to do everything whilst in Hahndorf or hike at Mount Lofty but if you are strapped for time this is a good alternative to tick it off the bucketlist. </p>
