  <p> Shoal Bay is located a 1 hour drive North of Newcastle in Port Stephens. Port Stephens is a collection of 26 beautiful beaches overlooking the Karuah River. Shoal Bay can be found on the Peninsula of Tomaree National Park. </p>

  <p> Shoal Bay is just one of the many spots to stop in Port Stephens however it is highly recommended due to the National Park surrounding it. Tomaree Mountain is set on the tip of the Peninsula and offers views over Shoal Bay and Port Stephens. </p>

  <p>  The hike to the top of The Tomaree Mountain takes between 20-30 mins at a normal walking pace, however it can get steep in some areas so allow yourself a little extra time if you want to take it slow. </p>

  <p> There are several lookout point at the top of the Mountain meaning you gets views out to sea, views of Mount Yacaaba on the opposite Peninsula and also over the Karuah River and Port Stephens.</p>

  <p> Spend the rest of the day hopping between the beaches starting with Shoal Bay for some relaxing and then venture out to Fingal Beach, Wreck Beach and Port Stephens Marina. </p>

  <p> If you are using public transport you can take 2 buses from Watt Street opposite Custom House in Newcastle towards Port Stephens or Shoal Bay, changing at Maitland Road opposite Beaumont Street. The journey will take roughly 2 hours. </p>
