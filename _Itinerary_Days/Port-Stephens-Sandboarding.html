  <p>   Stockton Sand Dunes are a popular tourist spot and offer a full day of fun.  </p>

  <p> You can either book a Sandboarding tour where you will be driven over the dunes in a 4WD minibus and will stop at the best sand boarding spot. This tour is 90 minutes and we can assure you you’ll be fully warn out from running back up the dunes after each ride so you’re going to want a lazy afternoon at the beach.

  <p>   NB: If you are doing the Moonshadow Dolphin Cruise you can book these 2 options together and save $$. More info can be found on the website. These 2 activities can be split over 1 or 2 days.</p>

  <p>   Unless of course, you’re a bit of a thrill seeker and you want some more time exploring the sand dunes. You can book a 1hour 45minute quad biking experience with The Quad Bike King https://www.quadbikeking.com.au/index.php. Choose between 2 different tour or combine them together. You’ll definitely have had enough for the day after these experiences!</p>

  <p>   Finish off at Murray’s Craft brewery where you can relax in the Beer garden with one of their many craft beers and a pizza with some live music.  </p>
