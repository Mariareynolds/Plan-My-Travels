  Spend a little more time on the Harbour by taking a Sydney Harbour Cruise. There are lots of different cruises that operate so there are plenty to choose from depending on what you taste is. There are options for High tea, 3 course dining or buffets lunches with bubbles. Some of the more popular cruises are with the below companies:

  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sydneyharbourlunchcruises.com.au/"> Sydney Harbour Lunch Cruises</a>

  If youâ€™re travelling over New Year I highly recommend are boat cruise to get the best view of the fireworks.

  Finish off your luxury lunch/dinner with a cocktail at one of the many famous spots in Circular Quay such as Cafe Sydney, Opera Bar or Aria Restaurant Sydney.
