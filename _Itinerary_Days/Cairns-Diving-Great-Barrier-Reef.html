  <p>Whether you have dived before or not, youâ€™re on the Great Barrier Reef and you should definitely give it a go. You can book guided dives if your PADI certified or discovery dives if you have never dived before. A discovery dive will cost around $240 for a full day on the reef and you will be able to dive to 6metres and get a feel for life on the reef. Look out for turtles, stingers and possible even some reef sharks.</p>
  <p> For those who are experienced divers you can also book full day tours on the reef for all different levels also at <a target="_blank" href="www.divingcairns.com.au/daytrips-cairns"> Cairns Diving </a> .</p>
