  <h2> Intro to Sydney</h2>
    <p> Sydney is one of the largest Cities in Australia and it is known for its iconic landmarks, such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. </p>
    <p> Sydney offers the perfect balance of beach life and city life, with some of Australia's most famous beaches being just a 15minute drive from the City. </p>
    <p> Aside from the tourist hotspots Sydney also offers lots of other activities such as bottomless brunches or hikes in the National park.</p>
    <p> If you're looking for a relaxing day and a vibrant nightlife Sydney has it all.</p>
    <h2>Getting Around</h2>

    <p>If you are flying in to Sydney airport you can catch the train from both the International and domestic airport straight to Central station or Circular Quay, you can use your contactless bank card to tap on and off, prices start from $17.39. Using a contactless bank card is cheaper than purchasing a ticket. However if you are travelling with others it may be cheaper to book an Uber.</p>

    <p>You can purchase an Opal Card to benefit from reduced fares. The initial ‘purchase’ is $10 but you will have $10 of credit so the card is essentially free. You can purchase a card from WH Smiths if you arrive from the International airport or alternatively you can search here for the nearest purchase point. https://transportnsw.info/opal-retailers#/ The cards can be topped up at stations or using the mobile app.</p>

    <p>Travelling on a Sunday is usually capped at $3 when using an opal card which means it is the best day for catching the Ferry’s as they are normally far more expensive. If you are spending a few days in Sydney once you have reached 8 journeys on your opal card your journeys for the rest of the week are significantly reduced. </p>

    <p>Travel around the City is really reasonably priced (much cheaper than travelling from the airport station which carries higher fee’s) for example Central to Circular Quay or Bondi Junction can be as little as $2.50. </p>
