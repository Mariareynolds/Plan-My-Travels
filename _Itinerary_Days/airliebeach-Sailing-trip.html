  There are hundreds of day tours to Whitehaven beach, I recently did the Thundercats tour which spends 2 hours on Whitehaven and also takes you to 2 dive spots, this is an ideal tour for anyone who loves snorkelling/diving. Whitehaven is a super famous spot and it’s beautiful. I recommend a tour that spends as long as possible here to fully enjoy it. Once you’ve walked along the lookout points and walked to the beach it’ll take around 30-40minutes so head back to the beach quickly to make the most of it. <a href="https://redcatadventures.com.au/"> Thundercats 1 day Island tour </a>

  You can also do a 2 day sail around the Whitsundays island. This is a very different style but will cover the same stops. You can either opt for a 1 or 2 night tour depending on the amount of time you have. This is a once in a life time opportunity and if you can handle the thought of sea sickness then I recommend it. It’s likely to be a young crowd and the tour will naturally take a slower pace between each stop as it’s a sailing boat rather than a fast boat. You can sunbathe on the deck of the boat and you’ll spend the evening sleeping there too.
  PowerPlay is a company recommended by Happy Travels based in Airlie Beach <a target="_blank" href="https://sailing-whitsundays.com/whitsundays/powerplay"> Powerplay 2 day sailing trip </a>

  I have done both of these options and my personal opinion is if you don’t mind being on a boat too long then I think you should do an overnight trip. It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to sail the Whitsundays.

  * If you don't that either of these tours are quite for you there are hundreds of other options and I'd be more than happy to have a look at other options. *
