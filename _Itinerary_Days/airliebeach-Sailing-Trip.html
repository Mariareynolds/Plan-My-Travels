  <p>There are hundreds of day tours to Whitehaven beach to choose from but a favourite amongst the locals is the Thundercats tour which spends 2 hours on Whitehaven and also takes you to 2 dive spots, this is an ideal tour for anyone who loves snorkelling/diving.
  Whitehaven is a very famous spot and popular film location. We recommend a tour that spends as long as possible here to fully enjoy it. Walking across the Island to the lookout points and then down to the beach could take up to 30-40minutes so head back to the beach quickly to make the most of it. <a href="https://redcatadventures.com.au/"> Thundercats 1 day Island tour </a> </p>

  <p>You can also do a 2 day sail around the Whitsundays island. This is a very different style but will cover the same stops. You can either opt for a 1 or 2 night tour depending on the amount of time you have. This is a once in a life time opportunity and if you can handle the thought of sea sickness then It is highly recommended.</p>
  <p>It’s likely to be a young crowd and the tour will naturally take a slower pace between each stop as it’s a sailing boat rather than a fast boat. You can sunbathe on the deck of the boat and you’ll spend the evening sleeping there too if you like.
  PowerPlay is a company recommended by Happy Travels based in Airlie Beach <a target="_blank" href="https://sailing-whitsundays.com/whitsundays/powerplay"> Powerplay 2 day sailing trip </a> </p>

  <p> It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to sail the Whitsundays and if you have the time an overnight stay on the reef would be the cherry on top. </p>

  <p>* If you don't think that either of these tours are quite for you there are hundreds of other options and We'd be more than happy to have a look at other options. * </p>
