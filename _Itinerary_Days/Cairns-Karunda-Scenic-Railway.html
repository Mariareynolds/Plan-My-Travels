  <a href="https://www.skyrail.com.au/" target="_blank">Kuranda Scenic Railway</a>  is a popular day trip in to the Rainforest. You can book a round trip on the Kuranda Railway or alternatively you can opt for the Skyrail gondola one way so you get to experience both.  Once you arrive in Kuranda you can visit the brightly coloured village markets, Rainforest Nature Park or the Kuranda Koala Gardens. It’s recommended that you allow 2-3hours in Kuranda  before taking the scenic journey back to Cairns.

  They railway and the skyrail each take an hour and a half, you can choose which route you take there and back and you can also book pick up and return transfers from your Cairns accommodation from $130.

<p> <span> Location: </span> Cairns </p>
<p> <span>Activity:</span> Explore the markets and Bar Crawl </p>
<p>Spend the day at the Cairns Lagoon. Much like Airlie Beach and Brisbane, Cairns has a man-made Lagoon right by the ocean where you can relax all day before heading out on one of Cairn’s famous bar crawls. Start the evening by heading to check out the Cairns night markets, they have some crazy good bargains here as well as pamper sessions and massages. After some browsing go to the Woolshed  for dinner and some table dancing before slowly making your way through all the bars in town and finishing the night at Gilligans, Cairns best Hostel for nightlife.
