  <p><a href="https://www.skyrail.com.au/" target="_blank">Kuranda Scenic Railway</a>  is a popular day trip in to the Rainforest. You can book a round trip on the Kuranda Railway or alternatively you can opt for the Skyrail gondola one way so you get to experience both.  Once you arrive in Kuranda you can visit the brightly coloured village markets, Rainforest Nature Park or the Kuranda Koala Gardens. Itâ€™s recommended that you allow 2-3hours in Kuranda  before taking the scenic journey back to Cairns.</p>

  <p>The railway and the skyrail each take an hour and a half, you can choose which route you take there and back and you can also book pick up and return transfers from your Cairns accommodation from a total of $130.</p>
