  <p>Whilst in Melbourne you will end up in Federation Square at some stage, it’s a great central meeting point to discover the culture of Melbourne.</p>

  <p>The square has some great pubs and restaurants such as the River Bar or Transport to start or finish your walk around the City.</p>

  <p>Walk from Federation Square along Birrarung Mar to the Sporting District.</p>

  <p>Melbourne’s Australian Open tennis courts and Cricket Ground are often hosting sporting events with great atmosphere. You can take a tour of the MCG FOR $31.50pp, tours normally last around 75 minutes.</p>

  <p>If sports isn’t your thing you could cross the bridge from Federation square and head to South bank where you’ll find endless bars and restaurants as well as Crown Casino. Southbank has a market on Sunday between 10:00 and 16:00. Southbank generally has great buskers and street artists.</p>

  <P>If it’s a clear day head up to the Eureka Skydeck for a view from above that stands 88 floors tall. It’s $20 entry to take in the 360 view of Melbourne. There’s also an option to walk out onto a boxed in platform with a glass bottom for an additional $12.</p>
