  <p>Day 2, leave early and get on the road heading back passed the 12 apostles, having covered this already you’ll be able to enjoy the drive straight passed the 12 apostles and on to the next hot spots. You will then be on the road early enough to do the full drive and you will also be driving in the opposite direction to the traffic giving you a little more privacy at each stop and less traffic on the route home. </p>

  <p>Wreck Beach(wattlehill)- A good spot to stretch your legs. A secluded beach about a 15min drive down an off road track.(Must have a 4WD) You can either hike up to a look out which can take upto 40mins or take the 375 steps down to the beach. If the tide is low there are 2 anchors visible from shipwrecks that have slowly been washed away over the years. </p>

  <p>Cape Otway- A large National Park with lots of hikes to choose from.
  You can also visit the Lightstation https://www.lightstation.com/ for $18.50 and listen to the guide talks as well as walk up to the top of the light house. </p>

  <p>Apollo Bay- A coastal Town which is a great place to stop, there are lots of different restaurants, here are trip advisors top 10 https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurants-g261654-Apollo_Bay_Victoria.html.
  Whilst in Apollo Bay you can head to the beach for some sun or even book a kayaking tour (90 minutes) to head out looking for fur seals. https://apollobaysurfkayak.rezdy.com/5302/seal-kayaking  the tours are $85, or alternatively you could hire some Stand Up paddle boards or take a surf lesson to break up the journey before getting back on the road towards Melbourne. </p>

  <p>Grey River road, Kennet River-  It’s a short detour off the Great Ocean Road but it’s worth it to spot some Koala’s, as you pull on to the Grey River Road (a short 10 minute detour off of the Great Ocean Road) keep your eyes peeled for the Koala’s that live here. </p>

  <p>Eastern View- The start of the great ocean road and where you will find The memorial Arch sign. A very quick photo stop to get a picture with the Great Ocean Road sign. From here it is roughly 2 hours back to Melbourne CBD. </p>

  <p>There are a few other popular beach towns on the drive back to Melbourne such as Lorne Torquay and Bells Beach so these are other stops for lunch and dinner depending on the time you have. </p>
