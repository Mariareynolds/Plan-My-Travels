  Whales migrate up and down the East coast of Australia along the coastline and the Gold Coast is a perfect place to spot them.  Book a Sea World tour https://seaworldcruises.com.au/whale-watch-tickets/ to catch a close up glimpse of the whales. Tours depart 3 times a day and run for 2 and a half hours. The boats have 3 decks and an onboard bar for refreshments. In the unlikely case that you are unable to see any Whales you will get a free return ticket.
  Tickets start at $89per adult however they are often advertising discounts online.

  Once you’re back on land and beaming from your day at sea book a table at Four Winds 360 restaurant. Four Winds is a 360 revolving restaurant that offers buffet lunches and dinners starting from $65 with an ever changing view.

<p> <span> Location: </span>Gold Coast </p>
<p> <span>Activity:</span> Burleigh Heads and Currumbin National Park </p>
<p> Burleigh Heads is the trendiest spot on the Gold Coast. Beautiful yet quiet beaches and a great atmosphere. Burleigh is a great spot to spend a night and relax mid way through your trip.
You can visit Currumbin wildlife centre to cuddle a koala and feed the karangaroo’s for a really reasonable price. Or if you just want to explore you you can visit Currumbin which is a small surf town, again with pretty beaches and coffee shops.
In the evening head to Burleigh pavilion for some nightlife. It has a great sunset spot on the water so soak up all the beach vibes.
