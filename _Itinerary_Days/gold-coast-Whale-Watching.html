  <p>Whales migrate up and down the East coast of Australia along the coastline and the Gold Coast is a perfect place to spot them.  Book a Sea World tour <a href=" https://seaworldcruises.com.au/whale-watch-tickets/">Sea World tour</a> to catch a close up glimpse of the whales. Tours depart 3 times a day and run for 2 and a half hours. The boats have 3 decks and an onboard bar for refreshments. In the unlikely case that you are unable to see any Whales you will get a free return ticket.(Recommend doing this on one of your first days on the Gold Coast incase you do need to rebook)</p>
  <p>Tickets start at $89per adult however they are often advertising discounts online.</p>

  <p>Once youâ€™re back on land and beaming from your day at sea, book a table at Four Winds 360 restaurant. Four Winds is a 360 revolving restaurant that offers buffet lunches and dinners starting from $65 with an ever changing view.</p>
