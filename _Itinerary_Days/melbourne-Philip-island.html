  <p>Philip Island is just a 90 minute drive south of Melbourne City. The Island is full of wildlife and you’ll be able to get up close with Koala’s, wombats and Dingos as well as catch the world famous Penguin parade. The Penguin Parade happens at dusk when around 4000 tiny penguin come out of the sea and walk to their little homes within the rocks for the night.
  You can either make your own way to Philip Island and book on to a penguin parade tour or you can take a day trip that will pick you up from Melbourne. The day trips are all day so it’s worth taking a few snacks for the journey etc however there will be opportunities to grab some food along the way.</p>
