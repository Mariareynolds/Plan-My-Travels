  <p>Eat Street has to be one of the best food markets around with over 70 different vendors selling all different cuisines. Eat street also has bars and retail vendors too. It’s a little way out of the City but definitely worth it to get a food fix you’ve been craving you can make it a full day out of eating drinking and shopping or just head here in the evening for something sweet dinner and drinks.</p>
  <p>From the City you can Catcha train to Teneriffe station which takes roughly 9mins. You may be able to get there by bus or walking also depending where you are staying. From here you will need to take a Ferry to Northshore Hamilton Ferry Terminal. If you have purchased a go card this ferry will cost roughly $3.60 however you can also purchase a single ticket from the machine for $4.90.</p>

  Take cash with you just to be on the safe side as some street vendors don’t accept card. There are ATM machines onsite however they may charge a fee. There is also a $3 entry fee per person which may be required in cash.

  Opening hours are Friday and Saturday 4pm to 10pm, Sunday 12 Noon to 8pm.

<p> <span> Location: </span> Brisbane </p>
<p> <span>Activity:</span> South Bank </p>
<p> Take a walk along Victoria Bridge towards South Bank where you'll find the Brisbane Wheel. The wheel is 200ft high, giving you a great view over Brisbane River. The tickets are $22 each for 4 loops.
Continue along South Bank to find the markets. The markets have a variety of clothes, artwork, jewellery and food stools and they are open Friday to Sunday. Once you've finished browsing you can get food and cocktails at South Bank Social, overlooking the  man-made beach. Brisbane has some good nightlife, fortitude valley is often recommended.

Get to Brisbane from either the Gold Coast or the Sunshine Coast via easy to navigate trains and buses. THis section of the East Coast is probably the easiest to get around using public transport and all within a few hours.
