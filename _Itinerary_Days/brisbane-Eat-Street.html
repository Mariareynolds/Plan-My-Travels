  <p>Eat Street has to be one of the best food markets on the East Coast,  with over 70 different vendors selling all different cuisines. Eat street also has bars and retail vendors too. It’s a little way out of the City but definitely worth it to get a food fix you’ve been craving you can make it a full day out of eating drinking and shopping or just head here in the evening for something sweet, dinner and drinks.</p>
  <p>From the City you can catch a train to Teneriffe station which takes roughly 9mins. You may be able to get there by bus or walking also depending where you are staying. From here you will need to take a Ferry to Northshore Hamilton Ferry Terminal. If you have purchased a go card this ferry will cost roughly $3.60 however you can also purchase a single ticket from the machine for $4.90.</p>

  <p>Take cash with you just to be on the safe side as some street vendors don’t accept card. There are ATM machines onsite however they may charge a fee. There is also a $3 entry fee per person which may be required in cash.</p>

  <p>Opening hours are Friday and Saturday 4pm to 10pm, Sunday 12 Noon to 8pm.</p>
