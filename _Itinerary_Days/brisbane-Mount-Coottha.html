  <p>Mount Coot-tha is just inland of Brisbane and is a great place to visit to get out of the City for the day and enjoy the epic views. You can catch public transport from Central station to the Mount Coot-tha Lookout however this will involve 3 bus changes and takes roughly an hour. Alternatively you can catch a train from central to Toowong station and get an Uber to drop you at the start of the JC Slaughter Falls picnic area.</p>

  <p>Mount Coot-ha has its own shuttle bus service that you can hop on and off between these stops:
  * Mt Coot-tha Lookout (also Kuta Cafe and Summit Restaurant & Bar) 
  * Sir Samuel Griffith Drive - Mt Coot-tha Car Park
  * Sir Samuel Griffith Drive - Mahogany Trail
  * Sir Samuel Griffith Drive - J. C. Slaughter Falls Picnic Area
  * Brisbane Botanic Gardens Mt Coot-tha (also Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium, Mt Coot-tha Library and Mt Coot-tha Visitor Information Centre).</p>

  <p>The shuttle runs as follows:
  summer (1 October to 30 April) - 8.40am-7pm
  winter (1 May to 30 September) - 9.40am-4.40pm.</p>

  <p>Mount coot-the Loop is a 10km hiking trail around Mount Coot-tha that is great for hiking, running or cycling. The trail has toilets and cafes dotted along the trail and passes JC Slaughter Falls, Powerful Owl trail and also the Mount Coot-ha summit where you will find the summit Restaurant and Bar https://www.summitbrisbane.com.au/menu/food-menu/.
  It’s worth stopping even if it’s just for a coffee at the Kuta cafe and to take in the views. </p>

<h2> DAY {{ forloop.index }}  </h2>
<img class="card" src="/images/southbankbrisbane.JPG" alt="South Bank Brisbane in the sunshine">
<p> <span> Location: </span> Brisbane </p>
<p> <span>Activity:</span> South Bank </p>
<p> Take a walk along Victoria Bridge towards South Bank where you'll find the Brisbane Wheel. The wheel is 200ft high, giving you a great view over Brisbane River. The tickets are $22 each for 4 loops.
Continue along South Bank to find the markets. The markets have a variety of clothes, artwork, jewellery and food stools and they are open Friday to Sunday. Once you've finished browsing you can get food and cocktails at South Bank Social, overlooking the  man-made beach. Brisbane has some good nightlife, fortitude valley is often recommended.

Get to Brisbane from either the Gold Coast or the Sunshine Coast via easy to navigate trains and buses. THis section of the East Coast is probably the easiest to get around using public transport and all within a few hours.
