<p> <span> Location: </span> Brisbane </p>
<p> <span>Activity:</span> South Bank </p>
<p> Take a walk along Victoria Bridge towards South Bank where you'll find the Brisbane Wheel. The wheel is 200ft high, giving you a great view over Brisbane River. The tickets are $22 each for 4 loops.
Continue along South Bank to find the markets. The markets have a variety of clothes, artwork, jewellery and food stools and they are open Friday to Sunday. Once you've finished browsing you can get food and cocktails at South Bank Social, overlooking the  man-made beach. Brisbane has some good nightlife, fortitude valley is often recommended.

Get to Brisbane from either the Gold Coast or the Sunshine Coast via easy to navigate trains and buses. THis section of the East Coast is probably the easiest to get around using public transport and all within a few hours.
