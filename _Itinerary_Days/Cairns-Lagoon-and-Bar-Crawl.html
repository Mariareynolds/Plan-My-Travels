  <p>Spend the day at the Cairns Lagoon. Much like Airlie Beach and Brisbane, Cairns has a man-made Lagoon right by the ocean where you can relax all day before heading out on one of Cairnâ€™s famous bar crawls.</p>
  <p> Start the evening by heading to check out the Cairns night markets, they have some crazy bargains here as well as pamper sessions and massages.</p>
  <p>After some browsing at the markets go to the Woolshed for dinner and some table dancing before slowly making your way through all the bars in town and finishing the night at Gilligans, Cairns best Hostel for nightlife.</p>
