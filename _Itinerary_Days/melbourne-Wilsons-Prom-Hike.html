  <p>Wilsons Promontory, known as Wilsons Prom is just under a 3 hour drive from Melbourne via the M1. As this is a National Park there is an entry fee of $9.</p>

  <p>Head towards Telegraph Saddle carpark where you will find the start of the 3.4km hike to the top of Mt Oberon for sunset. The hike should take roughly 45minutes to 1 hour. The view from the top is epic especially at sunset.</p>

  <p>There are some nice accommodation spots here however they can be pricey starting from $95 a night so make sure you do your research in advance and check what is available. If you’re looking for a unique stay then why not try out the Tidal River Luxury Glamping accommodation.</p>

  <p>Alternatively if you have a camper van there are lots of camping options in the area.</p>
