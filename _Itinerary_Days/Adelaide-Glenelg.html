  <p>Glenelg is the main beach town in Adelaide and is located a short 35minute FREE tram ride from the CBD. Glenelg is a long stretch of shallow shores and white sandy beaches and it’s a great spot to relax for the day.  </p>

  <p>When you arrive you should take a walk along the pier out to sea to get a view of the beach town before picking your spot on the sand for the day. </p>

  <p>A popular attraction in Glenelg is the Beachhouse. The beachhouse is the perfect spot to find your inner child, you can go on the bumper cars, bumper boats, arcade games, mini golf or even the water slides just off the main beach. </p>

  <p>If the Beachhouse entertainment centre isn’t your thing maybe you’d prefer a lunch date and cocktails on the beach at  <a href="https://www.themoseley.com.au/the-moseley-beach-club">The Moseley Beach Club</a> where you can lounge on day beds or picnic benches and sip your drink from a coconut. </p>

  <p>Make sure you check out Glenelg’s shops on Jetty Road, they have everything from boutique beach clothes to English sweet shops.</p>
