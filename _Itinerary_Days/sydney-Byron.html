  Greyhound buses which run twice a day take 12 and a half hours. Average price is $100-175 again depending on what day/season you are travelling.

  Flights from Sydney to Coolangata are on average $120-200, flights take roughly 1 hour.

  If you are looking to get to Byron or the Gold Coast from Coolangata Airport the Skybus operates every 2 hours with a one way trip at just $28 for the 55minute journey which is much cheaper than any of the taxi's available. It's worth checking the timetable in advance as you may find yourself just missing a shuttle and having to wait 2 hours.

  If youâ€™re looking for something cheaper you can get a train from Sydney central station direct to Casino station just south of Byron Bay, trains run twice a day and take 11 and a half hours. From here you can get a bus to Byron Bay which takes just over 1 hour, however these buses only run every 4 hours so make sure the timings add up before committing to this route.
