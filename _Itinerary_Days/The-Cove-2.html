  <p>Get up early for sunrise and take a walk along the beach front, it’s completely private and you’re likely to be one of the only people there. Enjoy the beach walk and maybe even head in for a swim if the water look inviting. </p>

  <p>Head back to the camp for some games, you have access to cricket bats, footballs and tennis rackets as well as games such as giant jenga, connect 4 and noughts and crosses.
  Maybe have another picnic with the rest of supplies you have bought before getting back on the road.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the National Park take a drive out to Green Patch Beach, one of the best in the National Park and often recommended to anyone visiting Jervis Bay. It’s a very small and quiet village with a little supermarket if you need to pick up some basic supplies. The beach is soft white sand and gentle waves and worth relaxing at for the afternoon. </p>
