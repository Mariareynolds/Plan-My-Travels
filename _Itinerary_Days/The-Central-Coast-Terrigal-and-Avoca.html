  <p> The Central Coast is just 1 hour North of Sydney and is the start of the North Coast. You can get here by train, bus or car from Sydney. </p>

  <p> The first place on your list should be Terrigal, a little coastal town with white beaches that are much quieter than what you will find in Sydney. Terrigal beach is a beauty and it’s surrounded by restaurants so you don’t need to go far after spending a day at the beach.</p>

  <p> Just outside of Terrigal you’ll find the famous Avoca beach, a popular spot and often rated in the top 10 beaches on the Northern Coast. Avoca is slightly smaller with fewer eateries however Becker and Co does a great breakfast/lunch menu with unique tastes such as the ham and pineapple toasties, not one for the Hawaiian haters out there. They have other great options and fancy coffees too.</p>

  <p>   Avoca Beach is the best of both world due to the sand dunes that have broken the ocean from an estuary, creating a lake right next to the ocean. The water is really shallow  and therefore super warm during summer and also very calm which gives you another option as the waves in the Ocean can be quite strong. </p>
  <p>Other favourites in the area are McMasters Beach, Copacabana and Umina Beach</p>
