  <p>The Barossa Valley is a must see in Adelaide, one of the most famous regions in the area itâ€™s recommended to spend the day hoping between wineries. </p>

  <p>If you have a car you can drive out to the Barossa Valley which is roughly an hour away and stay for the night in one of the boutique hotels and enjoy. However you will need to book a taxi from your hotel to the wineries as you are likely to be drinking quite a bit at each location. </p>

  <p>Alternatively you could book a day trip. There are lots to choose from that have very similar itineraries however one example is <a href="https://www.getyourguide.co.uk/activity/adelaide-l203/taste-the-barossa-small-group-premium-wine-tour-with-lunch-t176298?_gl=1%2av7x2ln%2a_gcl_aw%2aR0NMLjE1OTI4ODQ1MDYuQ2p3S0NBandyY0gzQlJBcEVpd0F4amRQVFFkWEhEOG81Z2NUdUtSbE55eTdhNGRSYUNfR1ZwcnhVZGJPeFRvQlVyRWVBOW5pZjJ2WmRob0NaN1lRQXZEX0J3RQ..&utm_force=0"> Small Group Premium Wine Tour</a>
  You will stop at 4 different wineries and enjoy some local foods along the way before being dropped back to the accommodation in Adelaide CBD or Glenelg. </p>

  <p>Alternatively if you are looking for a slower paced day at the wineries you could opt for <a href="https://www.getyourguide.co.uk/activity/adelaide-l203/adelaide-barossa-valley-and-hahndorf-day-tour-t43278?utm_force=0"> Barossa Valley and Hahndorf Day Tour</a> This tour visits 2 wineries in Barossa Valley as well as Hahndorf, a small historical town in the Adelaide Hills with little sweet shops and cafes and lots of History. </p>
