  Start with a breakfast yoghurt and smoothie at Sweet Byron on the corner of Jonsons and Lawsons street. Little tip if you can guess the weight of your frozen yogurt it will be free! Then make your way to Wategos Beach via Lighthouse Road. The walk to Wategos Beach is around 3km and will take roughly 45 minutes or just 7 minutes to drive from Main Beach. There is limited free parking so I recommend getting here before 10am or alternatively head just up the hill from the beach where you will find on street free parking. If you are looking to park just off of the beach you should again arrive early and be prepared to pay for parking that will be limited to a maximum of 4hours.

  Wategos Beach sits just under the Lighthouse surrounded by some of Byrons most prestigious properties. You'll find some serious #HouseGoals here and will probably start planning your retirement. You can make use of the public BBQ and picnic benches on the grass to the left hand side of the beach or maybe grab a coffee and from Soul Kitchen cafe. The beach is just perfect, the sand is pristine and the waters are warm and shallow meaning you can wade out and play with a ball or frisbee before the bank drops off.

  Finish off the day with sunset at The Wreck, located just off of the Main Beach in Byron, whilst listening to the performers in Apex Park, you'll find lots of street performers in Byron and this is a great spot to sit and relax amongst them.
  Once the sun has set head to The Balcony for cocktails and dinner.
  Tip: The Balcony has different offers each night of the week so do a little research and you may find some great deals.
