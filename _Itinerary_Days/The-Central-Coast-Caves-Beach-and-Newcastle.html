  <p> Caves Beach is located just south of Newcastle and itâ€™s a must stop on your journey. The name says it all, Caves beach is full of hidden caves that take you to hidden beaches.
  </p>

  <p>   A big mistake some travellers make is visiting at high tide making it extremely difficult and dangerous to enter the caves and is not advised. Check out the best time for low tide and make your way to the South end of the beach to Sea Cave. You should see an opening in to the cave just across the rocks, as long as the tide is heading out you should be able to walk through the cave and find the little tunnels they take you out to an otherwise unaccessible beach on the other side of the point. </p>

  <p> Please take extra care when visiting and make sure you are sure about the tide times as you do not want to end up stuck on the wrong side of the cave!</p>

  <p> After an adventurous beach day keeping heading North on your journey towards Newcastle. </p>

  <p> Once you have settled in Newcastle head to the Honeysuckle Hotel for an Espresso Martini with an atmosphere.  </p>
