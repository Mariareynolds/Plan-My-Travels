  <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.haveyouheardevents.com/theyachtsocialclub"> The Yacht Social </a> is an event held every weekend over the summer months. 8 yachts head out to the Harbour to create one big boat party. The boats all join in a ring and cover the centre with inflatables. It’s the ultimate day drinking trip.</p>

  <p>Tickets start from $125pp and will need to be booked in advance, although you may be able to get some last minute tickets via the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theyachtsocialclub/"> Yacht social Facebook group </a>. You can choose different standards of boats depending on the budget you have. All boats are BYOB and you can bring food for the BBQ’s also.</p>

  <p>Yacht Social boats arrive back at the port around 4pm and if you haven’t had enough partying for one day, head to the Eastern Beaches to continue, starting at Coogee Bay Beach Hotel.</p>
