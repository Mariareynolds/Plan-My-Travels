  <h2> Intro to Melbourne</h2>
    <p> Melbourne is a vibrant City in the South of Australia. It is known for being an artistic city with lots of beautiful graffiti laneways, quirky cafe's and rooftop bars.  </p>
    <p> Melbourne is surrounded by some great locations that are ideal for day trips. A few examples are Philip Islands to see the Penguins or maybe a trip to the Yarra Valley wine region. </p>

    <h2>Getting Around</h2>

    <p>If you are flying in to Melbourne you should book your flight to arrive at Tullamarine Airport. From here you can head to the SkyBus area outside of the terminal where you can get a bus in to the City for $19. When buying a ticket you will need to tell the service desk where your accommodation is or where you are heading and they will advise you which bus is best for you. </p>

    <p>You can purchase a Myki Card to benefit from reduced fares. The initial ‘purchase’ is $30 but you will have $24 of credit so the card is $6. You can purchase a card from most 7-Eleven’s or from Myki Machines at selected stations.  You can search for the nearest purchase point here https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/customer-service/staffed-stations/ The cards can be topped up at stations or using the mobile app if you have an Android phone.</p>

    <p>Melbourne also has a free tram zone from Queen Victoria Market to Docklands, Spring Street, Flinders Street Station and Federation Square. The City Circle Tram is also free.  More information about fares can be found at https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/travelling-on-the-network/visiting-melbourne-and-victoria/ </p>
