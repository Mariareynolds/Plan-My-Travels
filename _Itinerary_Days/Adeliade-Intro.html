  <h2> Intro to Adelaide</h2>
    <p>Adelaide is South Australia's Coastal Capital. Adelaide offers the Barossa Valley wine region, Kangaroo Island and some of the biggest festivals in Australia.  </p>


    <h2>Getting Around</h2>
    <p>If youâ€™re arriving in to Adelaide airport you can take either the JetExpress direct in to the City or the JetBus for Glenelg, West Beach and the City, servicing all routes. You will need a MetroCard which can be purchased from the airport ticket vending machine near the bus stop. </p>
    <p> Purchasing a MetroCard for $5 can save you just under $2 per journey you take on buses, even if your only staying for a short period of time it could save you a little bit of money, and as a backpacker you know that a little good deed from a stranger goes a long way, so why not pass the card on to another traveller when you leave.</p>
    <p>Adelaide also has a free Tram service through the City from North Terraces to South Terraces which means accessing Adelaide Central Markets, Adelaide Zoo and the Botanical	Gardens really easy. More information about the routes can be found at https://www.cityofadelaide.com.au/transport-parking/public-transport/trains-trams-buses/</p>
