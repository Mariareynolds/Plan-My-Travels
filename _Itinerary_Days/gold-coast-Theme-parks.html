  <p> You can choose from <a href="https://wetnwild.com.au/" target="_blank">Wet'n' Wild</a>, <a href="https://movieworld.com.au/attractions" target="_blank">Movie World</a> and <a href="https://seaworld.com.au/" target="_blank"> Sea World</a>  depending on what you enjoy  starting from $89 per adult or alternatively you can buy a 3 day pass which will get you access to all 3 parks for $139pp. The parks open at 9:30am however the rides don't start until 10am so it's handy to get there early and get in line for the first ride of the day to make sure you can do as much as possible.</p>

  <p>To get to Movie World and Wet 'n' Wild catch the train to either Coomera (if coming from Gold Coast) or Helensvale (if coming from Brisbane) station and transfer to bus route TX7.
  Getting to the theme park is easy with TX7 bus service which leaves Helensvale every 15 minutes, daily from 9:00am â€“ 11.30am.</p>

  <p>You can get to Sea World by catching the 705 bus from the corner of Ferny Avenue and Palm Avenue in Surfers Pardise. The bus will take roughly 15 minutes to get to the park and it will then be a 8-10 minute walk to the entrance. Buses run roughly every 15 minutes.</p>

  <p>All 3 theme parks have restaurants or cafes so you will be able to buy food and drinks throughout the day.</p>


  <p>If you are looking to get to Byron or the Gold Coast from the Coolangatta Airport the Skybus operates every 2 hours with a one way trip at just $28 for the 55minute journey which is much cheaper than any of the taxi's available. It's worth checking the timetable in advance as you may find yourself just missing a shuttle and having to wait 2 hours.

<p> THEME PARKS! Byron is around an hour from the Gold Coast theme parks so why would you not take at least one day to check out these parks. I'm not a huge theme park fan but Movie World was pretty cool plus there are loads of other parks to choose from depending on what you enjoy. The parks open at 9:30am however the rides don't start until 10am so it's handy to get there early and get in line for the first ride of the day to make sure you can do as much as possible. The best part is as the time zone is an hour behind you actually gain an hour when crossing the border meaning if you leave Byron at 9am you'll get to movie world at 9am, it's like magic!
