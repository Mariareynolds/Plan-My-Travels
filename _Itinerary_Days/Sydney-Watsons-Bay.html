  <p>Watson’s Bay is a beach spot on the Eastern Peninsula of Sydney Harbour. You can get to Watson’s Bay via Ferry from Circular Quay, they run roughly every half an hour. Use your opal card to tap on and off.</p>

  <p>Watson’s bay main beach is a quiet strip of beach right next to a beautiful park, which is ideal for families.
  If you’re looking for a picturesque and Instagramable beach then head around to Camp Cove Bay. It’s a narrow beach with waist height water and no waves and boats docked just off the shore. It’s is a great place to relax but I advised you get there early if you want to spread out on the beach as it is quite narrow and can get quite busy.</p>

  <p>If you’re looking for a place to eat head to Watson’s Bay Hotel for Cocktails, music and an all round great atmosphere.</p>
