  <p>Grab a coffee from the Lighthouse Cafe, a favourite amongst the locals and spend the day exploring the small town of Port Douglas, the most impressive spot being Four Mile Beach. You can probably image where it got it’s name so take along Four Mile Beach before you pick you spot to take a dip in the sea. </p>

  <p>Plan ahead and take a picnic with you so you don’t need to leave the beach food food or water anytime soon.  </p>

  <p>If you’ve had enough of the heat, head in to town for lunch at the Hi Tide Cafe, they have a great all day menu including, milkshakes, smoothies or cocktails depending on what you fancy.  </p>

  <p>As the afternoon starts to get a little cooler head up to either 4 Mile beach lookout or the Trinity Bay lookout at the North end of the beach. You’ll get a view across the whole coast and it’s a perfect photo spot to show off where you’re staying.  </p>

  <p>Finish up the day at The Court House Hotel for a few drinks and a lively atmosphere. It's a popular watering hole for the locals. </p>
