    <p>Arrive in Melbourne and spend the day in the City. Have a walk along the Graffiti Laneways, for example Hosier Lane, Degraves Street, Union Lane and Caledonian Lane are full of street art.</P>
    <p>It's also worth checking out the historic arcades to get a feel for the Melbourne culture. Check out Royal arcade and Block arcade on your way to Bourke street mall for some shopping.</p>
    <p>In the evening head to Curtin House Rooftop Bar to experience Melbourne nightlife. Melbourne is known for its cool bars and coffee shops </p>
