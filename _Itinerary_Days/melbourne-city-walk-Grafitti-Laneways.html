  Arrive in Melbourne and spend the day in the City. Have a walk along the Graffiti Laneways, for example Hosier Lane, Degraves Street, Union Lane and Caledonian Lane are full of street art.
  It's also worth checking out the historic arcades to get a feel for the Melbourne culture. Check out Royal arcade and Block arcade on your way to Bourke street mall for some shopping.

  In the evening head to Curtin House Rooftop Bar to experience Melbourne nightlife. Melbourne is known for its cool bars and coffee shops.â€¨
