  <p>Magnetic Island is a 12km island off the coast of Townsville. You can get the Ferry from Townsville Wharf which takes roughly 30 minutes. You can book a return ticket for $30pp if you book online. You can book on the day however make sure you arrive early enough to catch the Ferry you intend to as the queues can get long.</p>

  <p>Once you arrive on Magnetic Island hire one of the famous Topless “Barbie” Cars and take a drive around the island. You can hire these cars from $80 per day. Take a drive to one of the many beaches on the island, start at Horseshoe Bay which has stinger nets set up which means you will be able to swim without a stinger suit. It’s important to note that you should avoid swimming without a stinger suite or nets whilst in North Queensland.</p>

  <p>Once you’ve finished swimming start the walk towards either Radical Bay or Balding Bay, 2 of the prettiest beaches on the island.</p>

  <p>There are plenty of restaurants to choose from on the Island, two of the favourites are Up The Garden Path (reasonable prices and a range of cheaper or more expensive bites) and Boardwalk Restaurant and Bar(More expensive option, steaks and seafood platters).</p>

<p> <span>Activity:</span> Explore the markets and Bar Crawl </p>
<p>Spend the day at the Cairns Lagoon. Much like Airlie Beach and Brisbane, Cairns has a man-made Lagoon right by the ocean where you can relax all day before heading out on one of Cairn’s famous bar crawls. Start the evening by heading to check out the Cairns night markets, they have some crazy good bargains here as well as pamper sessions and massages. After some browsing go to the Woolshed  for dinner and some table dancing before slowly making your way through all the bars in town and finishing the night at Gilligans, Cairns best Hostel for nightlife.
