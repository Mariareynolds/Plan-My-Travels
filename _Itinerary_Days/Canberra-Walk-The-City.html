    <p>You must have ticket to enter the War Memorial, they are free to book online, you just need to register for a particular time slot to avoid overcrowding. You may be able to get tickets at the gate however it is subject to availability. Tickets allow you from 1-2hours access.
    </p>

    <p>Next up take a walk along Anzac Parade towards Commonwealth park and enjoy the view of Lake Burley Griffin. Cross the Waterloo memorial bridge and walk towards Capital Hill. This walk should take around 1 hour. </p>

    <p>Capital Hill is home to Parliament House and Embassy’s from all over the world as well as Australia’s National Portrait Gallery. The gallery is free to enter however you may be required to book a time slot online before arriving so they can manage capacity. Opening times are between 10am and 5pm. </p>
