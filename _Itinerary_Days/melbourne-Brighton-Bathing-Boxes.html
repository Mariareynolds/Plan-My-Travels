  <p>The Brighton Bathing boxes often feature in Melbourne’s Tourism campaigns so it’s worth heading out for the City for a day to see them for yourselves. A train from the city will take around 20 minutes on the Sandringham line. Catch it from Flinders Street Station to Brighton Beach Railway Station and take the scenic 500-metre stroll down to the multi-coloured bathing boxes.</p>

  <p>The Baths, Middle Brighton has a deck overlooking the beach and has a great breakfast/lunch menu aswell as cocktails and milkshakes. There is also kiosk if you just wanted to grab a coffee and a snack as you walk along the promenade.</p>

  <p>Spend the afternoon swimming and sunbathing or walk along the beachfront stopping at the dog parks and peaking in at the mega mansions along the beachfront.  </p>
