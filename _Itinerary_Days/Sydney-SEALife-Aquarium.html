  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/"> Sea Life Aquarium</a> is located in Darling Harbour. The doors open from 10am and you should allow around 2hours to walk around. If you’re looking for a more interactive experience you can book special experiences such as feeding the penguins, private dining or even extreme shark diving. Entry to the aquarium starts from $48 per adult, however they often have discounts up to 20% online.

  Spend the afternoon eating and drinking in Darling Harbour. The restaurants have happy hour from 3pm-6pm every day. Most venues have $5 beers and $10 cocktails as well as cheaper food deals during this time. If your looking for a nice setting on the Water try Cyren for cocktails and the best pizza’s. If you’re looking for something a little more lively head over to Pontoon Bar where the tables will clear to create a dance floor.

  If your in Darling Harbour on a Saturday night check online to see if the fireworks are happening as there’s a good chance you’ll be able to see them at 9pm.
