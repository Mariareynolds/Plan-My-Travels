  <h2> Intro to Brisbane</h2>
    <p>Brisbane is best known for being the Capital of Queensland. Brisbane has museums, science centres and  art galleries, as well as botanical gardens and a man made beach on the South Bank. Brisbane offers something for everyone, a little bit of City between the coastal towns along the East Coast.</p>


    <h2>Getting Around</h2>

    <p>If you are flying in to Brisbane you will be able to catch the train direct to Central station as well as many other locations across the City. The Airtrain runs roughly every 15 minutes (could be longer during off peak) and fares start from $15 to get to Central station. You can calculate the price of your journey here. https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/fares-and-zones
    </p>

    <p>If you are going to be using public transport when travelling between the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast you will need a GoCard. You can purchase a GoCard from Brisbane Airport train station or from other outlets such as 7-Eleven. More options can be found here. https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card/locations.  GoCards cost $10 and will need a minimum $10 at the time of purchase. You cannot use a bank card to tap on or off so you should purchase a Go Card as individual tickets are a lot more expensive if you plan to use lots of transport this will become costly.</p>

    <p>The City Hopper is a free cruise service that runs every 36 minutes to New Farm and back to North Quay.</p>
