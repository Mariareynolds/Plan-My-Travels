  <p>Spend a day in one of Sydney’s most affluent beach side suburbs, Cronulla.
  Cronulla is less than an hour from Central station. You can catch the T4 line directly to Cronulla and its a short 5 minute walk to the South Cronulla Beach. Cronulla is a great spot for a beach day, there are lots of beachfront cafes as well as locker-rooms.</p>
  <p>Spend the morning relaxing at Cronulla South Beach before starting the 4km beach walk track. Follow the Coastal path south and walk the loop around the Peninsula and end up back at South Beach.</p>

  <p>The coastal track has lots of secluded beach openings if you’re looking for a more private spot to enjoy the beach.</p>

  <p>Once you’re back in town there are lots of great food spots to try out. If you’re looking for a feast try out Milky Lane, the menu is full of feel good food, burgers, every kind of loaded fries, enormous thickshakes and cocktails. If you’re looking for something a little lighter grab a toastie or a salad from Barefoot on the Beach.</p>
