  <p>Melbourne's retail heart on Bourke St Mall links Swanston and Elizabeth streets and is only open to trams and pedestrians. Listen out for the bells of approaching trams as you drift between department stores and the flagship stores. Along Bourke St you’ll also find Australia’s two main department stores, Myer & David Jones. Melbourne’s GPO from 1854 is a multi-level shopping complex featuring H&M and similar stores. A short walk away is Emporium, with upmarket retailers and a great food court.</p>

  <p>For both a cultural and shopping experience head to The Queen Victoria Market. Spread over several city blocks with over 600 retailers the market is a reflection of Melbourne’s cosmopolitan make-up. Fruit, vegetables, local and imported goods, fashion and souvenirs. Warm up in the winter months with a hot jam donut and a coffee. Listen to the butchers advertise their specials and sample some artisan cheese and breads.
