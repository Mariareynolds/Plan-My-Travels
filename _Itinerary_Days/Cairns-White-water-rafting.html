  <p>One of the most popular activities in Cairns is White Water Rafting. Book a half day tour with https://www.foamingfury.com.au/barron-river-half-day/ and spend 2 full hours rafting along Barron river. You will be picked up from Cairns and taken 20 minutes to the Barron River where you will be given your equipment and taught some of the things you’ll need to know on the river. The Barron River has grade 3 rapids which is suitable for beginners. Prices start from $145.</p>

  <p>If you like the sound of White water rafting but you’re on a tighter budget you could book a river tubing trip on the Mulgrave river for $90. Again you will be picked up from Cairns and dropped back again. This experience will be roughly 4 and a half hours.</p>

  <p>You will need to take a towel, a change of clothes, suncream and some water.</p>

  <p>You’ve worked up an appetite so treat yourself to a nice dinner at the Salt House which offers one of the best seats in town. Right on the marina, they serve lunch and dinner and you can choose from the Bar, restaurant or pizzeria. This is the go-to for locals as it’s such a great location.</p>

<p>Spend the day at the Cairns Lagoon. Much like Airlie Beach and Brisbane, Cairns has a man-made Lagoon right by the ocean where you can relax all day before heading out on one of Cairn’s famous bar crawls. Start the evening by heading to check out the Cairns night markets, they have some crazy good bargains here as well as pamper sessions and massages. After some browsing go to the Woolshed  for dinner and some table dancing before slowly making your way through all the bars in town and finishing the night at Gilligans, Cairns best Hostel for nightlife.
