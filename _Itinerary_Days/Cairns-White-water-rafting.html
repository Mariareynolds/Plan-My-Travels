  <p>One of the most popular activities in Cairns is White Water Rafting. Book a half day tour with <a href=" https://www.foamingfury.com.au/barron-river-half-day/">Foaming Fury</a> and spend 2 full hours rafting along Barron river. You will be picked up from Cairns and driven 20 minutes to the Barron River where you will be given your equipment and taught some of the things you’ll need to know on the river. The Barron River has grade 3 rapids which is suitable for beginners. Prices start from $145.</p>

  <p>If you like the sound of White water rafting but you’re on a tighter budget you could book a river tubing trip on the Mulgrave river for $90. Again you will be picked up from Cairns and dropped back again. This experience will be roughly 4 and a half hours.</p>

  <p>You will need to take a towel, a change of clothes, suncream and some water.</p>

  <p>You’ve worked up an appetite so treat yourself to a nice dinner at the Salt House which offers one of the best seats in town. Right on the marina, they serve lunch and dinner and you can choose from the Bar, restaurant or pizzeria. This is the go-to for locals as it’s such a great location.</p>
