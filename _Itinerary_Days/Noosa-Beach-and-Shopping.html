  <p> Noosa is a boutique beach town, North of the Sunshine Coast Airport, that is full of coffee shops and luxury clothing stores, set amongst sprawling million dollar homes. Hastings street is the main shopping street, set metres back from the beach making it the ideal place to visit if you’re looking to treat yourself a little and relax at the beach once you’ve done so.
  You can either grab a coffee on Hastings street, every coffee shop is dog friendly and you will be surrounded by pooches, or try a vegan ice-cream from Happy Pops. The peanut butter flavour is the best ice-cream We’ve ever tasted! It’s like ice-cream thats not cold, It's very hard to explain so you will have to taste it for youselves.  If you’re looking for some summer clothes have a look at Goddess clothing for some beachy bargains.</p>
  <p>Spend the rest of the day at the beach and relax.</p>
  <p>Once you've finished your day at the beach you can take a walk along the everglades before dinner to catch a glimpse of your future #HouseGoals.</p>

  <p>You can get to Noosa from either Brisbane or the Sunshine Coast airport with regular buses and trains. The public transport in the area is great, it takes roughly a 1 hour from the Sunshine Coast airport by bus and costs no more than $8-10. If, however, you’d rather a direct route you can book a shuttle with Con-X-ion for around $35.</p>
