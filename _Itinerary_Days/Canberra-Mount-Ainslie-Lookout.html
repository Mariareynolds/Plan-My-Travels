    <p>The walk to the Mount Ainslie Lookout will take between 1.5-2hours from the War Memorial. Head towards the Australian Defence Force Academy on Fairbairn Avenue before turning left onto Mount Ainslie Drive. The walk up to the top is around 3km from here. </p>
    <p>Once you are at the lookout point you will have a view of the whole City looking straight down Anzac Parade from above. The view is worth the walk however you can also drive straight up to the lookout if your prefer to save yourself the walk. </p>

    <p>Alternatively if you fancy a more relaxed walk you can visit the Australian National Botanical Gardens to see the largest Flora display in Australia. You can stop for a coffee and a snack at Pollen which is set within the Gardens.
    </p>

    <p>If you are travelling during the summer months you can book yourself a seat at Sunset Cinema set within the Australian National Botanical Gardens. Tickets can be purchased online at https://www.sunsetcinema.com.au/canberra/ between November and March. Food and drinks stands are onsite or you can pack your own picnic.  </p>
