text: |
  <p>Visit Noosa's National Park and join one of the many walking tracks, I personally recommend the Coastal walk if you’re looking for scenic views and hidden beaches. Make sure you take some water and snacks for an afternoon at one of the beach stops.</p>
  <p>The Noosa Fairy Pools are hidden half way along the National Park Coastal track, if you’re wearing sturdy footwear you can climb along the rocks to the Fairy Pools that are often empty. If you check the tide times and the tide is low you can head in for a swim whilst the waves crash in. Be super careful and stay away from the edges in particular on the right hand side. I saw a few people standing on top of the rocks who were knocked in when the freak waves came in which could have been very dangerous. If you plan to swim stick to the central path that takes you down to the narrowest part of the Fairy Pool as seen in the picture.</p>
