  <p>Take the tram to St Kilda to visit Melbourne’s closest beach (Very different to the beaches on the East Coast).
  The quickest way to get there is the Tram, take the 96 from Bourke Street towards St Kilda. St. Kilda is a beachside destination about a 20 minute tram ride away. If it's a warm day head to Stand Up Paddle Board HQ to hire a SUP. You can hire a board for $30 for an hour between 9am and 1pm. <a target="_blank" href="https://supb.com.au/stand-up-paddle-board-hire/"> Stand Up Paddle Board HQ</a></p>

  <p>Whilst your here check out Luna Park!</p>

  <p>Luna Park is an old carnival style theme park at St. Kilda. It is generally open on the weekends and is free to enter. A ride costs $10.95 or you can buy unlimited rides for $47.50.</p>

  <p>Acland Street is a street in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda, which enjoys great popularity as a recreational area, mainly due to its many restaurants and its proximity to the entertainment areas along St Kilda beach. Have a wine at The Vineyard or have a coffee and cheesecake at Monarch Cakes. Down by the beach is a cool bar Republica that has a great menu.</p>

  <p>Take the Tram 16 back to the city (as opposed to the 96). This way you will travel along St. Kilda Rd and have an opportunity to jump off at the Shrine of Remembrance, Victoria’s memorial to the men and women who have served Australia in armed conflicts and peace keeping missions. The Shrine is open 10:00 – 17:00 every day. You could also wander through a section of the Botanic Gardens as you take the 1.3 km walk back to Federation Square.</p>
