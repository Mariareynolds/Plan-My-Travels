  <p> Newcastle has some pretty popular beach spots on the Northern Coast, one of these being Bogey Hole a man made ocean pool. Start the day with the Bather’s Way coastal walk between Nobby’s beach and Mereweather Baths stopping for a quick swim at Bogey Hole along the way. This walk should take 1.5-2hours without stopping at your favourite beaches along the way.  There is a 450 meter section of this walk set on the cliff tops above memorial drive and it’s worth the little detour to catch the views.
  Walk across the sand and out to Nobby’s Lighthouse at low tide.  </p>

  <p> If you’re looking to end the walk at a pub for the afternoon it’s recommended start at Mereweather Bathas and walk towards Nobby’s Beach as you will be close to Honeysuckle which is full of restaurants and bars.</p>

  <p>   A few suggestions are The Landing, The Dockyard, The Queens Wharf Hotel or a little further around the bay is  The Criterion who do a great lunch deal on weekdays.</p>

  <p>   If you’re interested in more beaches along the Coast, try Redhead beach or Dubley Beach for white sand and waves or Bongon and Frazer beaches for rock pool and plunge pools/ swimming holes. </p>
