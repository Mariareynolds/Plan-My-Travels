  <p> <p>Arrive at The Cove for day 1 off the grid. In order to get to The Cove you will be driving through the National Park, which means you may be required to pay the National Park fee which is $13per vehicle. The roads are extremely uneven and it is recommended to have a car that isn’t too low to the ground and preferably a 4WD. This road continues for nearly 30 minutes and you’ll be sure you are lost before finally arriving at the the beautiful Cove. </p>

  <p>From the moment you arrive you will want to be snapping pictures of everything. You’ll have kangaroo’s hopping passed you and possums and Kookaburra’s spying you from the tree’s.</p>

  <p>From here it’s time to unwind, take a bath, sit by the fire, unpack the picnic and relax. </p>

  <p>Book out a kayak or stand up paddle board for a couple of hours in the afternoon and paddle upstream towards…. Where you’ll find a little fish and chip shop. Take a quick stop for some food on the banks before heading back for more relaxing in the evening. </p>

  <p>The Cove has BBQ’s, Pizza ovens so you can cook up a storm in one of the many chill out spots before settling in by the fire pits with some friendly kangaroos and some marshmallows. </p>
