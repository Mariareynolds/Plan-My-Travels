  <p> The Grand Canyon Hike is one of the longer of the Blue Mountains but itâ€™s definitely a favourite. You will drive straight to Evans Lookout in Blackheath which gives you an idea of the kind of views you can expect on this hike.   </p>

  <p> From Evans Lookout car park you will see the sign posts for the Grand Canyon Walk, this route is a 6km loop and will take roughly 3 hours however you should allow a little more time for stopping and of course taking lots of pictures.</p>
  <p>You can find out a little more about this hike at https://sydneyuncovered.com/grand-canyon-walk-blue-mountains/
  You can also park at the Grand Canyon Loop car park and do the walk in reverse if you prefer (It depends where you are travelling from) </p>

  <p>  After your morning walk treat yourself to High Tea at the https://www.hydromajestic.com.au/dining/hydro-majestic-afternoon-high-tea a very popular spot in Blackheath, with views overlooking the Megalong Valley. High Tea starts from $65pp and Gluten free options are available. Make sure you book a slot in advance as this is a popular spot and might not have availability for walk ins. </p>
