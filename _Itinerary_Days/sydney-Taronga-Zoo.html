  You can make your way to Taronga Zoo either by bus or ferry depending where your based in the City.
  I recommend taking the Ferry from Circular Quay directly to Taronga Zoo, you can only do this if you have also purchased a ticket that allows you access to the Skycar  as the Skycar will pick you up from the Ferry terminal and take you over the top of the Zoo enclosures to the entrance of the Zoo.
  It’s a great way to start you Zoo experience as you can see lots of the animals roaming their enclosures. 
  If you have not rebooked tickets or got access to the Skycar then you can catch a bus from Wynyard station that will take you over the Harbour Bridge and drop you at the entrance. Taronga Zoo has a cafe and also a large restaurant that serves hot food such as burgers and chips or fish and chips, as well as ice cream and light snacks. 
  Tickets are normally around XXX and can be purchased online at ... You can also purchase experiences such as behind the scenes tours with Australian animals or even an overnight stay in the animal kingdom.

<h2> DAY {{ forloop.index }}  </h2>

<p> <span>Activity:</span> Whitsundays Island Tour</p>
<p> There are hundreds of day tours to Whitehaven beach, I recently did the Thundercats tour which spends 2 hours on Whitehaven and also takes you to 2 dive spots, this is an ideal tour for anyone who loves snorkelling/diving. Whitehaven is a super famous spot and it’s beautiful. I recommend a tour that spends as long as possible here to fully enjoy it. Once you’ve walked along the lookout points and walked to the beach it’ll take around 30-40minutes so head back to the beach quickly to make the most of it. <a href="https://redcatadventures.com.au/"> Thundercats 1 day Island tour </a>

You can also do a 2 day sail around the Whitsundays island. This is a very different style but will cover the same stops. You can either opt for a 1 or 2 night tour depending on the amount of time you have. This is a once in a life time opportunity and if you can handle the thought of sea sickness then I recommend it. It’s likely to be a young crowd and the tour will naturally take a slower pace between each stop as it’s a sailing boat rather than a fast boat. You can sunbathe on the deck of the boat and you’ll spend the evening sleeping there too.
PowerPlay is a company recommended by Happy Travels based in Airlie Beach <a target="_blank" href="https://sailing-whitsundays.com/whitsundays/powerplay"> Powerplay 2 day sailing trip </a>

I have done both of these options and my personal opinion is if you don’t mind being on a boat too long then I think you should do an overnight trip. It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to sail the Whitsundays.

 * If you don't that either of these tours are quite for you there are hundreds of other options and I'd be more than happy to have a look at other options. *
