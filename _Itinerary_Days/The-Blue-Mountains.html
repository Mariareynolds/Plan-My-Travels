  <p> Catching sunrise in the Blue Mountains is a must and the best way to do this is to head to one of the Blue Mountains lookout points that don’t require any hiking, such as The Three Sisters Rocks.  The Three Sister are a popular tourist spot and are often very busy with tour companies so if you’re going to see it, it’s probably best to come for sunrise before the crowds turn up.   </p>

  <p> From here head to Wentworth Falls for a short hike, roughly 45 minutes to an hour. The hike is Grade 3 which means you must be wearing suitable footwear etc however it should require above normal fitness. You can find out a little more about this hike here https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/wentworth-falls-track </p>

  <p>  Now you’ve earnt yourself a nice lunch so head towards Leura to check out some of the village cafes and shops. The Red Door cafe is a great spot for breakfast and lunch and they serve a great coffee, however many of the little breakfast/lunch spots along the high street are great.  </p>

  <p> If you’re looking for a seat with a view head to Solitary which is in Katoomba, the outdoor seating area has a view over the Jamison Valley and you’ll be able to chose from an extensive menu.   </p>

  <p> In the afternoon check out a few more lookout spots that don’t require any hiking such as Lincoln Rock (near Wentworth Falls so may be worth doing this at the same time, depending how hungry you are before lunch!) Blackheath Lookout and  Pulpit Rock Lookout.</p>
