  <h2> Intro to The Gold Coast</h2>
    <p>The Gold Coast is known for its long stretches of beaches and it's high profile suburbs including Burleigh Heads. The Gold Coast has a wildlife centre that allows you to get up close with the Australian animals as well as Internationally known theme parks.</p>


    <h2>Getting Around</h2>

    <p>If you are going to be using public transport when travelling between the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast you will need a GoCard. You can purchase a GoCard from outlets such as 7-Eleven. More options can be found here. https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card/locations.  GoCards cost $10 and will need a minimum $10 at the time of purchase. You cannot use a bank card to tap on or off so you should purchase a Go Card as individual tickets are a lot more expensive if you plan to use lots of transport this will become costly.
