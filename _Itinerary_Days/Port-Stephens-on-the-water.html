text: |
    <p> Spend a day heading out on to the water to getting a closer look at the pod of 140 resident Dolphins that live here. </p>

    <p>   You can start the day with the  https://moonshadow-tqc.com.au/cruises/dolphin-cruises/ Moonshadow Dolphin Cruise from $30, you’ll be out on the boat for an hour and a half looking for Dolphins and spotting your next beach spot from the water. The your swimmers with you as you will get the chance to relax on the boom net in the water. This cruise departs from Nelsons Bay which is between Port Stephens Marina and Shoal Bay.</p>

    <p>
    NB: If you are doing the Sandboarding on the Dunes trip you can book these 2 options together and save $$. More info can be found on the website. These 2 activities can be split over 1 or 2 days.</p>

    <p>   Head back to land for some lunch in Nelsons Bay, You can get a take away from Bubs Fish and Chips and sit on the beach, but bare in mind they only accept cash! If you’re looking for something a little more upmarket try Sandpipers for an Australian Seafood blend and a dine in restaurant. </p>

    <p> Head back to Shoal Bay in the afternoon to visit Paddle Port Stephens where you can hire kayaks and paddle boards from $30 for 1 hour or maybe try hiring a water bike for $45. </p>

    <p> If you didn’t get enough of the Dolphins why not try a kayaking tour, starting from $60 for the chance to kayak alongside them. Paddle Port Stephens can’t always guarantee a Dolphin sighting but I’m sure it’s worth a try and you’ll still enjoy the 2.5hour tour on Port Stephens.</p>
