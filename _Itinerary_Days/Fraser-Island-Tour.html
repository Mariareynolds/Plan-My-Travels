  <p>There are loads of different tours that cover Fraser Island so it depends how you want to do it. Fraser is always an East Coast highlight for those who do it. There are different styles of tours so here are 2 options.</p>

  <p>Cool dingos tours are either 2 or 3 days long. They are guided tours on a coach big enough for roughly 30 people. The accommodation is bunk style dorm rooms. Or you have the option to pay extra for a private room with a shared bathroom. I really enjoyed the 3 day tour and would recommend it however if you are really tight on time the spots that are must see’s are Lake Mackenzie, Eli Creek, Champagne pools and Maheno Shipwreck, all of which are covered in the 2 day tours with cool dingos.</p>

  <p> All tours seem to cover the same spots however, some offer self drive 4x4’s and camping style accommodation, one that comes recommended was Pippie’s if you would prefer this.</p>

  <p>NB: These tours can pickup from Rainbow beach which is just under 2 hours north of Noosa.
  If you are short on time do a 2 day tour instead of 3. The best parts will be covered on the first 2 days.</p>
