  <h2> Intro to Byron</h2>
    <p>Byron Bay is the hippie hotspot of the East Coast of Australia and it has loads to offer including, surfing, hidden beaches, boutique shops with beautiful clothes and a care free vibe.</p>
    <p>Expect to have adventurous days with chilled evenings listening to the local buskers.</p>


    <h2>Getting Around</h2>
    <p>If you are looking to get to Byron  from the Coolangatta Airport the Skybus operates every 2 hours with a one way trip at just $28 for the 55minute journey which is much cheaper than any of the taxi's available. It's worth checking the timetable in advance as you may find yourself just missing a shuttle and having to wait 2 hours.

    <p>Byron doesnâ€™t have any other form of public transport once you are in town however everything is easily accessible on foot or by taxi.</p>
