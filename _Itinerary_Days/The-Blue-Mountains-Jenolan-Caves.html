  <p> The Jenolan Caves are nestled into the Blue Mountains, they are roughly 90 minutes from Leura which is one of the main accommodation hubs. </p>

  <p> There are 15 different cave tours run by https://www.jenolancaves.org.au/ that cover the best of the Jenolan Caves. Group sizes are up to 35 people and prices range from $42-55 per adult for standard packages.  Most tours last for 90 minutes meaning you can do more than 1 if you can’t decide which tour to pick.</p>
  <p> Each cave offers a different experience so have a look at the details of each before you book, you can also see pictures of each cave which should help you make a decision.  </p>

  <p> If your not looking to book a tour there is one cave that is open for free to the public. Nettle Cave is an open air cave meaning it is slightly different to the others and therefore has a different shape and style however it’s a great option for a passing visit or to tick it off the bucket list on a budget. </p>

  <p> Visit Caves House Hotel for lunch or dinner at Chisolm’s restaurant. They have one of few large dining halls left in the area and they offer an a la carte menu. Pop in to Jeremiah’s Bar for a drink afterwards. This is a great place to pick for lunch if you are looking to do 2 tours in one day with a stop for lunch in the middle.  </p>
