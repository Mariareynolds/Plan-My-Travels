  <h2> Intro to Canberra</h2>
    <p>Canberra is Australia's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall. Located between Australia's 2 largest cities, Melbourne and Sydney.  </p>
      <p>Canberra is the capital city of Australia and is home to the nations Parliament house.</p>

    <h2>Getting Around</h2>
    <p>After arriving at Canberra airport you can head straight for the Airport bus station to catch a bus in to the City. Buses can vary from 30-45 minutes depending on the route. However if you are happy to pay a little more, especially if travelling in a group you can get a taxi for the roughly 10 minute journey.</p>
    <p>Canberra has buses and light rail trains that cover the majority of the City making it really easy to get around. You can either purchase a MyWay Card for $20 with $20 worth of credit or pay by cash for each of your journeys. Purchasing a MyWay Card saves you roughly $1.30 per journey however this may not be worth it if you are not in Canberra for long as when purchasing a cash ticket for $5 it last for 90 minutes which may work out more cost effective than purchasing the MyWay Card for $20.</p>
    <p>If you donâ€™t carry cash you must purchase a MyWay card.</p>
