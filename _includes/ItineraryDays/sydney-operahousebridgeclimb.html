<p> Sydney Opera House tour.
Tickets can be bought for $42. The tour is roughly an hour long and will teach you about the architecture of the building and some of the iconic performances that have taken place there. If this isn’t your thing you can still take a walk along the Quay and take pictures of this hotspot as well as the Harbour Bridge. https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/visit-us/tours-and-experiences/english-tour.html

Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb.
It’s a little pricey but if It’s been on your bucket list and you only plan on being here once then I’d say it’s worth it. I did the twilight tour which I recommend.  It takes around 3.5 hours. The starting price for this climb is $270 however it can get a bit more expensive depending on the time of day you decide to book and also weekends vs weekdays. https://www.bridgeclimb.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8W8l5UAoqmUZY3ZaPAPbZiM1AQxcf7o2gCFQ0eKAI6ufGUjP93x1d4aAkzcEALw_wcB

Lunch/dinner at the Opera house. Considering the location the Opera bar is really well priced. Great cocktails and a beautiful backdrop.  https://www.operabar.com.au/menu-eat </p>
