<h2> DAY {{ forloop.index }} </h2>
<p> <span> Location:</span> Brisbane </p>
<p> <span>Activity:</span> Explore the City </p>
<p> You can get to Brisbane by public transport anywhere along the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast. If you've spent most of your trip exploring beaches and the great outdoors you could spend the day in the City. Head to Queens Street Mall for some shopping and maybe get some lunch at Jimmy's on the Mall. Jimmy's is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and offers live music and a great cocktail menu.
Then maybe take a river cruise to check out the city from the water. If you're looking for nightlife head to Fortitude Valley. </p>
