  Take an early morning drive out to Killen Falls, it's around a half an hour drive and then just a 10 minute walk to the waterfall. Make sure you are in comfortable shoes as it can be a little slippery. The waterfall sits over a cave meaning you can walk behind it or set up in the shade whilst you're swimming beneath the waterfall. I recommend getting here early, before 8:30am if you want instagramable shots without the crowds however if you are just heading out for a swim turn up anytime. The final stop is Minyon Falls. Minyon falls is a 45 minute drive North of Killen falls in Nightcap National Park. The waterfall itself is 100m high and you can take an 8km circuit hike to see the top and bottom of the waterfall. However one thing to take in to consideration is the weather, I took the 40 minute drive on a nice hot day and found one very dried out waterfall. So at 8:00am It was a little frustrating, however I thought I'd do a little exploring. At the top of the waterfall there were a few pockets of water that are deep enough to use as plunge pools overlooking the national park so it was still worth the visit.
