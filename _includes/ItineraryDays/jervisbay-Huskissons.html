<p> <span> Location: </span>Jervis </p>
<p> <span>Activity:</span> Huskissons Bay </p>
<p> Jervis Bay is a coastal town around 3 hours South of Sydney. The best place to stay is Huskissons Bay as it offers the most shops and restaurants. The majority of the surrounding is either a National park or secluded beach. The best part about Jervis Bay is the fact its so private, the beaches offer lots of space and are rarely busy, even on public holidays. Once you have arrived at Huskissons Bay grab some breakfast or lunch at one of the local boutique Cafes before heading over to the peninsula. Huskissons  beach is very unique as you can see it but you can’t reach it from the main town. The beach is a peninsula  so you have to drive back out of town and around to the peninsula. There are very little waves in the harbour which means it’s a great place to paddle board or kayak. In the afternoon head out to one of the many recommended hidden beaches in the area, for example Honeymoon Bay. Honeymoon Bay offers a very narrow stretch of beach but it’s a great place to relax as the bay has almost no waves meaning you can relax in the waste height waters or go a little further out for some snorkelling. </p>
