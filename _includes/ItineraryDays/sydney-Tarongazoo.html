<p> <span>Activity:</span> Taronga Zoo Day Trip </p>
<p> Taronga Zoo You can make your way to Taronga Zoo either by Bus or Ferry depending on where you are in the City. I recommend taking the Ferry from Circular Quay directly to Taronga Zoo, you can only do this if you have also purchased a ticket that allows you access to the Skycar  as the Skycar will pick you up from the Ferry terminal and take you over the top of the Zoo enclosures to the entrance of the Zoo. It’s a great way to start you Zoo experience as you can see lots of the animals roaming their enclosures. If you have not rebooked tickets or got access to the Skycar then you can catch a bus from Wynyard station that will take you over the Harbour Bridge and drop you at the entrance. Taronga Zoo has a cafe and also a large restaurant that serves hot food such as burgers and chips or fish and chips, as well as ice cream and light snacks. ickets are normally around XXX and can be purchased online at …. You can also purchase experiences such as behind the scenes tours with Australian  animals or even an overnight stay in the animal kingdom. </p>
